Although other cryptocurrencies have come before, Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency - Its reputation has spawned copies and evolution in the space.</p><p>With the largest variety of markets and the biggest value - having reached a peak of 18 billion USD - Bitcoin is here to stay. As with any new invention, there can be improvements or flaws in the initial model however the community and a team of dedicated developers are pushing to overcome any obstacle they come across. It is also the most traded cryptocurrency and one of the main entry points for all the other cryptocurrencies. The price is as unstable as always and it can go up or down by 10%-20% in a single day.</p><p>Bitcoin is an SHA-256 POW coin with 21,000,000 total minable coins. The block time is 10 minutes. See below for a full range of Bitcoin markets where you can trade US Dollars for Bitcoin, crypto to Bitcoin and many other fiat currencies too.</p><p>Learn about the history of Bitcoin <a href="https://fried.com/history-of-bitcoin/" target="_blank">here</a> and check out 50 crazy-fun facts about Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinplay.net/58-insane-facts-about-bitocin/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>', '<p><strong>Mobile payments made easy</strong> Bitcoin on mobiles allows you to pay with a simple two step scan-and-pay. No need to sign up, swipe your card, type a PIN, or sign anything. All you need to receive Bitcoin payments is to display the QR code in your Bitcoin wallet app and let your friend scan your mobile, or touch the two phones together (using NFC radio technology).</p><p><strong>Security and control over your money</strong> Bitcoin transactions are secured by military grade cryptography. Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf. So long as you take the required steps to protect your wallet, Bitcoin can give you control over your money and a strong level of protection against many types of fraud.</p><p><strong>Works everywhere, anytime</strong> Just like with email, you don&#39;t need to ask your family to use the same software or the same service providers. Just let them stick to their own favorites. No problem there; they are all compatible as they use the same open technology. The Bitcoin network never sleeps, even on holidays!</p><p><strong>Fast international payments</strong> Sending bitcoins across borders is as easy as sending them across the street. There are no banks to make you wait three business days, no extra fees for making an international transfer, and no special limitations on the minimum or maximum amount you can send.</p><p><strong>Choose your own fees</strong> There is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Most wallets have reasonable default fees, and higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it&#39;s possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 bitcoin.</p><p><strong>Protect your identity</strong> With Bitcoin, there is no credit card number that some malicious actor can collect in order to impersonate you. In fact, it is even possible to send a payment without revealing your identity, almost just like with physical money. You should however take note that some effort can be required to protect your privacy.</p>', '<p><strong>Balances - block chain</strong> The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.</p><p><strong>Transactions - private keys</strong> A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining.</p><p><strong>Processing - mining</strong> Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends.</p>', 21000000.00, NULL,

While most cryptocurrencies are created as an alternative to bitcoin, ARCH was created as a startup holding DAC whose equity is represented by a cryptographic token. The goal is to test new applications of blockchain technology as well as to model an investor-token relationship in a use-case scenario involving a real startup with palpable products and services. To improve equity fungibility, revenue from any of the holding company&#39;s products or services is to be used to purchase more tokens from the market, thereby making the holding DAC&#39;s equity token exponentially more valuable with each additional revenue stream. Although no substantial revenue has been injected into ARCH&#39;s fungibility yet, its tiered conditional access levels have created a natural self-audit system that has proven very effective when it comes to managing this pseudo-corporate setup and its investors. Value in information is trusted to investors according to their own responsibility in the pseudo-corporate structure. In this tiered setup, the amount of tokens held serves as a basis of evaluating trust and involvement with the DAC itself. This system promotes unbiased transparency by the developers and corporate responsibility on behalf of the investors. This system alone, without any major revenue stream, has already proven itself as the backbone of the current stable growth in the ARCH equity token&#39;s market cap.</p><p><br /><span>This unique approach opens doors for a new generation of DACs, fusing decentralized communities with traditional corporate structures using tiered conditional access levels to secure the flow of information. Although tailored to our specific ventures and “community” needs, the ARCH wallet concept is an outstanding, first-of-its-kind example for other future DACs looking to combine all relevant information and tools regarding the DAC&#39;s and its equity token in one place. ARCH is taking that concept even further and seeks to integrate the whole corporate structure into its wallet as the DAC grows. </span><br /><br /><span>In a nutshell, Arch rearranged how investors interacted in DACs to establish healthier lines of communication while changing the financial structure so that FIAT revenue would be injected directly into the tokens fungibility instead of being distributed through dividends.</span><br /><br /><span>Their products, services and software are inspired by bitcoin, disruptive and innovative but not interdependent.</span></p>', NULL, NULL, 16403135.00, NULL, 'Cryptsy~ARCH~BTC,Poloniex~ARCH~BTC,BTER~ARCH~BTC,BitTrex~ARCH~BTC', 0),

Transaction confirmations are fast due to the 60 second block time and the difficulty retargetting is every block based on DigiShield. The one percent premine is used in the Nautlius stabilisation fund to ensure liquidity in the market.</p><p>As pointed out by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q3 “The Economics of Digital Currencies”, Bitcoin faces three challenges: 1) Volatility 2) Sustainability of Low Transaction Fees 3) Limitations of a Fixed Money Supply. Nautiluscoin was designed to address and eliminate the challenges faced by Bitcoin.</p><p>he Nautiluscoin Stability Fund seeks to reduce volatility, while the Proof of Stake algorithm does away with the need for expensive mining equipment. Additionally, at the heart of the Proof of Stake reward calculation is an algorithmic monetary policy that adjusts money supply with demand.</p><p>The Nautiluscoin economy is built on the foundation of a strong currency policy and the view that a strong economy requires a currency which preserves purchasing power. Creating a fertile environment for an economy to develop requires the continuous pursuit of stability. But the pursuit of stability is not just about reducing daily price fluctuations.</p><p>For Nautiluscoin to be truly successful it must preserve and increase purchasing power. Daily price stability is important for consumers and merchants to transact, but the long run success of any currency is a function of purchasing power. If users of a currency believe that their ability to purchase goods and services in the future will be diminished then they are less likely to hold and use the currency. Therefore the most important goal for Nautiluscoin will be to maintain a strong currency with a stable and growing purchasing power.</p><p>In order to accomplish its strong currency goal, Nautiluscoin will compete with economics. Traditionally central banks with a strong currency policy are charged with providing an anchor for the economy through the use of money supply targets, interest rate targets, and/or exchange rate targets. Economic history has shown that these targets require the central bank to have significant resources in order to credibly accomplish the targets. Most successful targeting policies rely on an unlimited resource which is classically the ability to print or borrow money. In the case of Nautiluscoin, the terminal money supply is fixed by the software code and there are not public debt markets to use as an interest rate targets. However, this does not mean it lacks arrows in the quiver.</p><p>Because the terminal money supply is fixed and released over time we have the ability to set the growth rate of the money supply. As well, the Nautiluscoin network will be secured through proof-of-stake method which will pay interest to those who desire to hold Nautiluscoin. Finally, the mining process allows us to support the exchange rate by using mining profits to purchase Nautiluscoin. </p>', NULL, NULL, 16180000.00, NULL, 'BitTrex~NAUT~BTC,Poloniex~NAUT~BTC,Cryptsy~NAUT~XRP,Cryptsy~NAUT~BTC', 0),

XRP exists as a math-based currency on the Ripple protocol.</li><li><strong>Abuse Protection<br /></strong>The primary function of XRP is to protect the Ripple protocol against denial-of-service (DoS) spam attacks. Since the Ripple protocol is based around a shared ledger of accounts, a malicious attacker could create large amounts of “ledger spam” (such as fake accounts) and “transaction spam” (such as fake transactions) in an attempt to overload the protocol. This could cause the size of the ledger to become unmanageable and interfere with the protocol’s ability to quickly settle legitimate transactions.</li><li><strong>Bridge Currency</strong><br />XRP has great value as a bridge currency. Because each gateway’s balances trade as distinct assets within Ripple, the number of potential currency pairings can become quite large. Instead of quoting every possible currency/gateway combination, XRP can serve as a useful bridge currency to enable these transfers. This is possible because if every currency is liquid to XRP, then every currency is liquid to every other currency:</li></ul>', '<p><strong>The Ledger and Consensus</strong><br />The Ripple protocol is, at its core, a shared public database. This database includes a ledger, which serves to track accounts and the balances associated with them. The ledger is a distributed database — a perfect, shared record of accounts, balances, and transactions in the Ripple protocol. It is continually and automatically updated by the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) so that an identical ledger exists on thousands of servers around the world. At any time, anybody can review the ledger and see a record of all activity on the Ripple protocol. When changes are made to the ledger, computers connected to the Ripple protocol will mutually agree to the changes via a process called consensus. The Ripple protocol reaches consensus globally within seconds of a change being made. The consensus finding process is the engineering breakthrough that allows for fast, secure, and decentralized transaction settlement on the Ripple protocol.</p><p><strong>The World’s First Distributed Exchange<br /></strong>No one owns or controls the Ripple protocol. It runs on computers around the world, all working together to continually maintain a perfect, shared record of accounts, balances, and transactions. Distributed networks offer many efficiencies over centralized networks. Because the network is “self-clearing”, it eliminates the need for a centralized network operator (and gets rid of the associated layer of fees). Because there is no single point of failure, distributed networks are more reliable.

The goal of this project is to reinvent digital currencies from the manner that wallets are distributed and installed, to the method that coins are earned and spent.

Simply download the software, install it, and begin mining today! "Mining" is lingo for discovering new Bytecent, similar to panning for gold. In actuality, mining is simply the process used to verify Bytecent transactions on the network.There are approximately 1440 coins generated per day, so finding new Bytecent can take a few hours or a few days depending on the speed of your computer. Mining Bytecent is fun and allows anyone with no mining experience or technical knowhow to begin mining immediately!

Whether the end-user has excellent credit, bad credit or no credit, anyone can use Bytecent. You will never be denied or restricted from using Bytecent.</p><p>I<strong>mmediate Transactions</strong> Money transfer services and bank wire transfers can be costly, and transaction times can vary from a few minutes to a few days.

It is the first step towards having an unbanked investment world where an independent digital currency asset yields returns in an alternate medium of exchange. OMC plans to be a major inflation and investment vehicle for the cryptocurrency community as well as various brick-and-mortar entities.</span></p><p><span><strong>Taking the first step towards an unbanked society</strong><br /><br /><span>The core principle of Omicron&#39;s investment platform is to allow investors to own a digital asset that adds value to itself- just like shares in a dividend-issuing company. Easily transferable for a quick turnover without the need of intermediary brokers, the OMC asset will be the choice dividend vehicle for investors around the globe. Biweekly dividends ensure that no matter the price of the asset, the asset owner always will receive a 0.00001% share of the dividend pool, per Omicron, every 2 weeks.</span><br /><br /><br /><strong>How are BTC dividend-yields accrued and issued?</strong><br /><br /><span>BTC dividends will be funded every 2 weeks through trading on the volatile altcoin market as well as lending capital for margin-trading exchanges (stable interest). The loan interest guarantees a biweekly issuance of dividends, while the altcoin trading revenue is a major bonus, many times greater than loan yields. The trading yields aren&#39;t guaranteed biweekly as there may be an occurrence where there is a net loss during the timeframe. A minimum balance of 10,000 OMC in an address will be required to qualify for dividend yields. A BTC address must be associated with the OMC address, which will be done through the main website, and soon through the Omicron client itself.</span></span></p>', '<p><strong>Transparency and Solvency</strong><br /><br /><span>Trust is a major issue in the unregulated industry that cryptocurrency is. The Omicron investment platform will prove solvency biweekly, by revealing copies of trading summaries, balance statements, and further evidence that OMC is solvent and paying from revenue, not from capital. Independent audits by high profile members of the Bitcoin community will be allowed every 2-3 months to make sure that data provided biweekly is accurate and not forged or modified in any way.</span><br /><br /><br /><strong>Quick turnover and a market</strong><br /><br /><span>Omicron will be the first dividend-issuing asset that will be able to be traded on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. The quick turn over on exchanges will make OMC a superior investment vehicle than any existing dividend-issuing company today. Issuing dividends at a faster rate than most businesses, the market will be fast paced and a choice asset to trade as daytraders make their moves on dividend performance. As OMC adds value to itself through continuous dividend payouts, long term holders of the asset will experience a steady increase to the value of their investment as well as pocketing biweekly revenue.</span></p>', '<p><span>Omicron will be a blockchain based asset, and a clone of Bitcoin. Minting through the wallet will yield 5%/annum, compounding on a daily basis. The clients that will be released on Sept 17 will have a fresh overhaul to the interface, and there will be future modifications to add simplicity to OMC-BTC address linkage and addtional add-ons. Fullstack developers will be paid and employed to implement said features. The main focus of Omicron is to provide a suitable and superior investment vehicle than dividend-issuing companies. With this in mind, there will be no brand new technical developments made for OMC. Modifications will be ported from other cryptocurrency clients to keep OMC top of the line.</span></p>', 3371337.00, NULL, 'Yobit~OMC~BTC,Yobit~OMC~DOGE,Yobit~OMC~WAVES,Yobit~OMC~RUR,BitTrex~OMC~BTC,Yobit~OMC~ETH,Yobit~OMC~USD', 0);

In the Ethereum protocol and blockchain there is a price for each operation. The general idea is, in order to have things transferred or executed by the network, you have to consume or burn Gas. The cryptocurrency is called Ether and is used to pay for computation time and for transaction fees.</p><p>If you want to earn block rewards from the network, you can join the network as a miner.

It is developed and maintained by ETHDEV with contributions from great minds across the globe. There is also an Ethereum foundation and there are multiple startups working with the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Ethereum is currently on the "Homestead" stage and all its related software is still considered Beta until the release of the next stage "Metropolis". </p><p>If you are looking for a GUI interface for your wallet, try the Ethereum Wallet DApp. It&#39;s still in beta so be careful when you use it.</p><p>Our block explorer data bellow is freely provided by <a href="https://etherchain.org/" target="_blank">etherchain.org</a> and <a href="http://etherscan.io/" target="_blank">etherscan.io</a>. </p>', '<p>Ethereum is a platform that is intended to allow people to easily write decentralized applications (Đapps) using blockchain technology. A decentralized application is an application which serves some specific purpose to its users, but which has the important property that the application itself does not depend on any specific party existing. Rather than serving as a front-end for selling or providing a specific party&#39;s services, a Đapp is a tool for people and organizations on different sides of an interaction use to come together without any centralized intermediary.</p><p>Contracts generally serve four purposes:</p><p>- Maintain a data store representing something which is useful to either other contracts or to the outside world; one example of this is a contract that simulates a currency, and another is a contract that records membership in a particular organization.</p><p>- Serve as a sort of externally owned account with a more complicated access policy; this is called a "forwarding contract" and typically involves simply resending incoming messages to some desired destination only if certain conditions are met; for example, one can have a forwarding contract that waits until two out of a given three private keys have confirmed a particular message before resending it (ie. multisig). More complex forwarding contracts have different conditions based on the nature of the message sent; the simplest use case for this functionality is a withdrawal limit that is overrideable via some more complicated access procedure.</p><p>- Manage an ongoing contract or relationship between multiple users. Examples of this include a financial contract, an escrow with some particular set of mediators, or some kind of insurance. One can also have an open contract that one party leaves open for any other party to engage with at any time; one example of this is a contract that automatically pays a bounty to whoever submits a valid solution to some mathematical problem, or proves that it is providing some computational resource.</p><p>- Provide functions to other contracts; essentially serving as a software library.</p><p>Contracts interact with each other through an activity that is alternately called either "calling" or "sending messages". A "message" is an object containing some quantity of ether (a special internal currency used in Ethereum with the primary purpose of paying transaction fees), a byte-array of data of any size, the addresses of a sender and a recipient. When a contract receives a message it has the option of returning some data, which the original sender of the message can then immediately use. In this way, sending a message is exactly like calling a function.</p>', '<p><strong>Sandwich complexity model</strong>: the bottom level architecture of Ethereum should be as simple as possible, and the interfaces to Ethereum (including high level programming languages for developers and the user interface for users) should be as easy to understand as possible. Where complexity is inevitable, it should be pushed into the "middle layers" of the protocol, that are not part of the core consensus but are also not seen by end users - high-level-language compilers, argument serialization and deserialization scripts, storage data structure models, the leveldb storage interface and the wire protocol, etc. However, this preference is not absolute.</p><p><strong>Freedom</strong>: users should not be restricted in what they use the Ethereum protocol for, and we should not attempt to preferentially favor or disfavor certain kinds of Ethereum contracts or transactions based on the nature of their purpose. This is similar to the guiding principle behind the concept of "net neutrality". One example of this principle not being followed is the situation in the Bitcoin transaction protocol where use of the blockchain for "off-label" purposes (eg. data storage, meta-protocols) is discouraged, and in some cases explicit quasi-protocol changes (eg. OP_RETURN restriction to 40 bytes) are made to attempt to attack applications using the blockchain in "unauthorized" ways. In Ethereum, we instead strongly favor the approach of setting up transaction fees in such a way as to be roughly incentive-compatible, such that users that use the blockchain in bloat-producing ways internalize the cost of their activities (ie. Pigovian taxation).</p><p><strong>Generalization:</strong> protocol features and opcodes in Ethereum should embody maximally low-level concepts, so that they can be combined in arbitrary ways including ways that may not seem useful today but which may become useful later, and so that a bundle of low-level concepts can be made more efficient by stripping out some of its functionality when it is not necessary. An example of this principle being followed is our choice of a LOG opcode as a way of feeding information to (particularly light client) dapps, as opposed to simply logging all transactions and messages as was internally suggested earlier - the concept of "message" is really the agglomeration of multiple concepts, including "function call" and "event interesting to outside watchers", and it is worth separating the two.</p><p><strong>Have No Features</strong>: as a corollary to generalization, the dev team often refuses to build in even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol, with the understanding that if people really want to do it they can always create a sub-protocol (eg. ether-backed subcurrency, bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin sidechain, etc) inside of a contract. An example of this is the lack of a Bitcoin-like "locktime" feature in Ethereum, as such a feature can be simulated via a protocol where users send "signed data packets" and those data packets can be fed into a specialized contract that processes them and performs some corresponding function if the data packet is in some contract-specific sense valid.</p><p><strong>Non-risk-aversion</strong>: the dev team is okay with higher degrees of risk if a risk-increasing change provides very substantial benefits (eg. generalized state transitions, 50x faster block times, consensus efficiency, etc)</p>', NULL, NULL, 'TuxExchange~ETH~BTC,Exmo~ETH~RUB,BitBay~ETH~USD,WavesDEX~ETH~WTRY,Gateio~ETH~USDT,Quoine~ETH~PHP,Gatecoin~ETH~HKD,Remitano~ETH~USD,WavesDEX~ETH~TOM,Exmo~ETH~BTC,Kucoin~ETH~USDT,HitBTC~ETH~EUR,EthexIndia~ETH~INR,Coinone~ETH~KRW,EXX~ETH~BTC,WavesDEX~ETH~STA,Remitano~ETH~NGN,Cryptsy~ETH~BTC,Bitstamp~ETH~USD,Exmo~ETH~UAH,QuadrigaCX~ETH~BTC,BitSquare~ETH~BTC,LiveCoin~ETH~USD,BTCMarkets~ETH~AUD,HitBTC~ETH~USD,CHBTC~ETH~CNY,Novaexchange~ETH~BTC,Coinroom~ETH~GBP,Remitano~ETH~GBP,Poloniex~ETH~BTC,OKEX~ETH~BTC,Huobi~ETH~CNY,OKEX~ETH~USDT,WavesDEX~ETH~BTC,Cryptsy~ETH~LTC,BitBay~ETH~PLN,BitFlip~ETH~BTC,CCEX~ETH~DOGE,Cryptopia~ETH~DOGE,Liqui~ETH~USDT,WavesDEX~ETH~MNY,EXX~ETH~HSR,Cryptopia~ETH~UNO,Quoine~ETH~USD,Lykke~ETH~BTC,Kraken~ETH~USD,Quoine~ETH~HKD,BitTrex~ETH~BTC,Yunbi~ETH~BTC,Bitso~ETH~BTC,HitBTC~ETH~BTC,Remitano~ETH~VND,Tidex~ETH~WUSD,Bleutrade~ETH~DOGE,Yunbi~ETH~CNY,Bleutrade~ETH~BTC,BTCE~ETH~LTC,Exmo~ETH~PLN,Lykke~ETH~CHF,Gatecoin~ETH~USD,Kucoin~ETH~BTC,BitBay~ETH~BTC,Kraken~ETH~GBP,BitZ~ETH~BTC,BitZ~ETH~USDT,Kraken~ETH~BTC,Cryptopia~ETH~BTC,Tidex~ETH~USDT,CCEX~ETH~LTC,Remitano~ETH~ZAR,Tidex~ETH~WAVES,Bitstamp~ETH~BTC,Gatecoin~ETH~DAI,WavesDEX~ETH~MGO,Cryptopia~ETH~NZDT,TrustDEX~ETH~BTC,ViaBTC~ETH~CNY,Cryptsy~ETH~USD,Binance~ETH~BTC,WavesDEX~ETH~USD,Remitano~ETH~CAD,BTCE~ETH~RUB,Bitfinex~ETH~BTC,Zaif~ETH~JPY,BTCE~ETH~EUR,BTC38~ETH~CNY,Kraken~ETH~JPY,LiveCoin~ETH~RUR,Remitano~ETH~SGD,Binance~ETH~USDT,Gateio~ETH~BTC,BitZ~ETH~DKKT,Cexio~ETH~GBP,Yobit~ETH~USD,Gatecoin~ETH~EUR,Yobit~ETH~DOGE,Remitano~ETH~PKR,Quoine~ETH~IDR,BitFlip~ETH~RUB,BTER~ETH~BTC,Abucoins~ETH~BTC,OKCoin~ETH~CNY,QuadrigaCX~ETH~CAD,Coinbase~ETH~BTC,Quoine~ETH~AUD,CCEX~ETH~USD,Coinroom~ETH~EUR,WavesDEX~ETH~EUR,EXX~ETH~USDT,Exmo~ETH~USD,Exmo~ETH~USDT,Yobit~ETH~WAVES,Liqui~ETH~BTC,Quoine~ETH~EUR,Remitano~ETH~PHP,Bitso~ETH~MXN,BitTrex~ETH~USD,BitGrail~ETH~XRB,BXinth~ETH~BTC,Exmo~ETH~EUR,BXinth~ETH~THB,TrustDEX~ETH~VND,TrustDEX~ETH~AIC,WavesDEX~ETH~BCH,Lykke~ETH~EUR,Yobit~ETH~BTC,TheRockTrading~ETH~BTC,Coinroom~ETH~PLN,WavesDEX~ETH~IRA,BitFlip~ETH~EUR,BTCE~ETH~USD,Remitano~ETH~KES,TheRockTrading~ETH~EUR,Kraken~ETH~CAD,bitFlyer~ETH~BTC,Lykke~ETH~LKK,Remitano~ETH~CNY,Cryptopia~ETH~USDT,Abucoins~ETH~PLN,HuobiPro~ETH~BTC,OKCoin~ETH~USD,Quoine~ETH~SGD,Coinroom~ETH~USD,Coinbase~ETH~USD,Cexio~ETH~USD,Bithumb~ETH~KRW,Tidex~ETH~BTC,Bitfinex~ETH~USD,BTER~ETH~CNY,Tidex~ETH~WEUR,WavesDEX~ETH~WAVES,TrustDEX~ETH~USDT,Quoine~ETH~JPY,Bitstamp~ETH~EUR,Gatecoin~ETH~BTC,Coincap~ETH~USD,Lykke~ETH~USD,Remitano~ETH~MYR,BitFlip~ETH~USD,Cexio~ETH~BTC,Yobit~ETH~RUR,Exmo~ETH~LTC,Gemini~ETH~BTC,BitFlip~ETH~UAH,Kraken~ETH~EUR,BitGrail~ETH~BTC,BitBay~ETH~EUR,LiveCoin~ETH~BTC,Poloniex~ETH~USD,Coinbase~ETH~EUR,Zaif~ETH~BTC,Quoine~ETH~BTC,HuobiPro~ETH~USDT,Jubi~ETH~CNY,WavesDEX~ETH~B@,Remitano~ETH~INR,Lykke~ETH~GBP,EtherDelta~ETH~ETH,Korbit~ETH~KRW,Cryptopia~ETH~LTC,Remitano~ETH~TZS,LakeBTC~ETH~BTC,BTCMarkets~ETH~BTC,Cexio~ETH~EUR,BTCE~ETH~BTC,CCEX~ETH~BTC,Gemini~ETH~USD', 0),

In addition, since it doesn’t require awarding all coins to miners, it enables distribution of the cryptocurrency in any way the coin creator deems to have the highest strategic value for the growth and adoption of the coin - a true blank slate.</p><p><strong>Strategic Coin Distribution</strong></p><p>To make a cryptocurrency viable, consumers, the service providers that make it useful, and buyers are all critically important. To incentivize participation by all these actors, NeuCoin’s non-profit foundations will award coins to each constituency in proportion to the value they bring to NeuCoin. Besides achieving the fairest possible distribution of the cryptocurrency, this design also maximizes its long-term value. </p><p>To optimize for growth and adoption, a large share of the foundations’ endowment will be given to consumers in exchange for engaging with, trying out, and referring friends to NeuCoin. Another large block will be awarded to companies that help NeuCoin grow its user base and become more useful: game publishers and content providers that accept microtransactions with NeuCoin tokens, exchanges, wallets, consumer mining services, payment processors, remittance services, discounted group shopping services, marketing and distribution partners and other key services to NeuCoin users. Finally, some will be sold, with proceeds used by the foundations to increase the value of NeuCoin through consumer marketing, utility development, and core coin development.</p><p><strong>Offering Consumers Something Useful to Do </strong></p><p>For consumers to want a cryptocurrency, they have to be able to do something with it that they can’t do better with traditional payment methods. From the very day that the cryptocurrency launches, NeuCoin will offer more utility and consumer-friendly services than most cryptocurrencies: free NeuCoin tokens through an engaging website, an easy online wallet and a web-based mining service that lets consumers grow their coins without ever having to even see the word “mining” or any other tech jargon. To keep incentivizing third party companies to constantly develop more services and utility, the NeuCoin Utility Foundation will pay large bounties to integrate with service providers that make it more useful: game publishers and premium digital content providers (#1 priority) exchanges (#2 priority, in all geographic markets), payment processors, wallets, and international remittance providers.</p><p><strong>Rolling Out Microtransaction Solutions</strong></p><p>Microtransactions may be the killer app of cryptocurrency, giving consumers access to new types of commerce not viable with traditional payment methods, such as &lt;$1 transactions for playing or leveling up a casual game, tipping, pay-per-view, ad-free content, tiny amounts of work or advice, small donations, etc. To quickly build utility in this key strategic area, NeuCoin is developing two prototype online/mobile games based on popular, generic games that will demonstrate how NeuCoin can be incorporated into game experiences - giving out free NeuCoins as a reward for playing, winning, leveling up, etc. Having a meaningful userbase of NeuCoin-holding players will be an important leverage point as we work with leading game publishers with large exisiting user bases to integrate NeuCoin. NeuCoin has also entered partnerships with leading players in the online video, music and artist promotion spaces to develop microtransaction platforms for tipping and paid premium content. These pilot partners will help optimize user experience, conversion and monetization, after which the platforms will be rolled out to additional content providers in the music, video, photo, blog, social media publishing, adult, podcast and other areas.</p><p><strong>Freemium Marketing to Consumers</strong></p><p>In today’s digital economy, offering a free entry-level service is key to easing consumers into a new consumer experience. After having a positive first experience some users will buy more, or find ways to earn more. This has been a critical success factor for growth and conversion for premium consumer services like Dropbox, Skype, Viber, Whatsapp, Spotify, Candy Crush Saga. </p><p>NeuCoin’s distribution strategy enables it to fuel its marketing with freemium tokens (giving users a few free NeuCoin to get started). This minimal friction is key for user adoption. NeuCoin will put a heavy focus on conversion-driven marketing, with game-like tutorials and interactive onboarding that qualifies, educates and rewards users - with no tech to read or understand and no personal information or money down to get started. Finally, social referral programs will reward free NeuCoin tokens to people who help recruit other users; special programs and bounties will be available for people active in the crypto community, influential bloggers and content creators, celebrity endorsers, etc.</p><p><strong>Rewarding Early Adopters </strong></p><p>People who get in early on NeuCoin - who help create the first core of users and holders - will be highly rewarded for adding this value. NeuCoin’s economic model uses very high PoS awards, starting at 100% per year in year one, 80% in year two and gradually declining to 6% by year ten, meaning that coin holdings will multiply by up to 50X over 10 years with non-stop PoS mining.</p><p><strong>Transparency and Governance</strong></p><p>NeuCoin will be open, accountable and ultimately controlled by coin holders. NeuCoin’s core code development, user growth programs, and projects to increase utility will be supported by three non-profit foundations based in Isle of Man: the Code, Growth and Utility foundations. All foundations are ultimately controlled by NeuCoin holders (1 NeuCoin = 1 vote), who have the power to hire, fire and set compensation for the foundations’ Council Members, and have a right of approval on annual budgets, spending priorities and other matters.

The design of Grøstl is transparent and based on principles very different from those used in the SHA-family.The two permutations used are constructed using the wide trail design strategy, which makes it possible to give strong statements about the resistance of Grøstl against large classes of cryptanalytic attacks. Moreover, if these permutations are assumed to be ideal, there is a proof for the security of the hash function.</p><p>- Can and is accelerated by the hardware AES support present in most modern Intel CPUs, which helps reduce the efficiency gap between a CPU and other implementations. Groestl (old GPU/CPU) - Groestl makes wide range of trade-offs between throughput, latency, and power consumption. Because of this, groestl uses less power per hash than other algos. Due to the less complex hashing, groestl performs well on older GPU’s as well as CPU’s.</p><p>- Is the single most efficient algorithm for GPUs in the cryptocurrency market. It has been shown to have the lowest power consumption, heat and noise of recently released algorithms, allowing for a quieter and more effective mining environment. </p><p>- Is set to be the future of mining, Groestlcoin is proud to be the first to utilize this new efficient algorithm.</p><p>- Is a recently proposed cryptographic hash algorithm that has common structure and features with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The objective of this paper is to present the design of a high speed joint implementation of Grøstl and AES with minimal resources using a pipelining method. The advantage of this implementation is that it efficiently provides both cryptographic hash function and block cipher. The system is targeted to the Altera Cyclone IV FPGA. The paper presents a complete description of the design and implementation, as well as an analysis of the resulting synthesis and comparison to other proposed implementations of the Grøstl hash function.</p><p>- Is a byte-oriented SP-network which borrows components from the AES. The S-box (substitution-box) used is identical to the one used in the block cipher AES and the diffusion layers are constructed in a similar manner to those of the AES. As a consequence there is a very strong confusion and diffusion in Grøstl.</p><p>- Is a so-called wide-pipe construction where the size of the internal state is significantly larger than the size of the output. This has the effect that all known, generic attacks on the hash function are made much more difficult.</p><p>- Has good performance on a wide range of different platforms and counter-measures against side-channel attacks are well-understood from similar work on the AES.</p><p><strong>About the AES acceleration:</strong></p><p>The compression function f is based on a pair of 256- or 512-bit permutation functions P and Q, and is defined as:</p><p>f(h, m) = P(h ⊕ m) ⊕ Q(m) ⊕ h</p><p>The permutation functions P and Q are heavily based on the Rijndael (AES) block cipher, but operate on 8×8 or 8×16 arrays of bytes, rather than 4×4. Like AES, each round consists of four operations:</p><p>1.AddRoundKey (the Grøstl round keys are fixed, but differ between P and Q)</p><p>2.SubBytes (this uses the Rijndael S-box, allowing sharing with AES implementations)</p><p>3.ShiftBytes (expanded compared to AES, this also differs between P and Q, and 512- and 1024-bit versions)</p><p>4.MixColumns (using an 8×8 matrix rather than Rijndael&#39;s 4×4)</p><p>Grøstl divides the input into blocks and iteratively computes hi = f(hi-1, mi).

More people using Sia means more funding available to hire more developers.</p><p>Standard transactions are not subject to the fee, and neither are failed storage contracts (where the host was offline or lost the file).</p>', '<p>The foundation of Sia is a proof of work blockchain. Storage contracts are a new type of transaction that get enforced by the blockchain. Sia&#39;s hashing algorithm is blake2b. p2pool and multisig wallets are both supported on Sia.</p><p>  When a file is uploaded to Sia, a storage contract is created containing the Merkle root of the file, a reward for the host, and a penalty for the host (both in siacoins). After an agreed-upon duration, the host is required to prove that the file is still available by providing a random Merkle proof. If the proof is valid, the host is rewarded; otherwise, the host is penalized.  Random numbers are generated deterministically using the most recent block as a seed.</p><p>Sia has support for two way payment channels, and two way contract diffs.  Among other things, this provides massive scalability, and eliminates the need for untrustworthy 0-confirmation transactions. Once you join a payment channel network, all transactions within that network will be instant and final, with no risk of a double spend.</p><p>Reliability is achieved by using erasure coding in a massively distributed environment. Erasure coding allows a file to be split into many pieces, such that the original file can be recovered using only a few of them. For example, you can take a 50 MB file, break it into 200 pieces that are 1 MB each, and then you can recover the original file from *any* 50 of the pieces. This method has the same overhead as creating 4 complete copies of the file, yet is much more reliable because it&#39;s much less likely that 151 out of 200 hosts will go offline than it is that 4 out of 4 hosts will go offline.</p><p>As the network grows, we will apply statistical analysis to determine the redundancy required to provide 99.9999% reliability on files. It is likely that 3x overhead is absurd overkill, and statistical analysis will give an accurate picture of how much overhead is required.</p><p>Using 200 hosts to store a file means that downloads can be massively parallel. Even if the average Sia host does not have quick upload speeds, the massive parallelism enabled by Sia means that downloads will be blazing fast anyway.  In addition, you can choose to connect only to the datacenters that are the closest and the fastest. This optimization (known as a CDN) is a hugely expensive project for a traditional cloud storage service, but for Sia it is a natural consequence of the decentralized network.</p><p>As security is a top priority of Sia, all encryption is performed locally; the people storing your files will have no ability to see what you have uploaded.  Not only is every file encrypted separately, every *piece* of every file is encrypted separately, and hosts are not told which pieces are part of the same file.</p>', NULL, NULL, 'Poloniex~SC~BTC,BitSquare~SC~BTC,Yunbi~SC~CNY,HitBTC~SC~BTC,Abucoins~SC~BTC,Cryptopia~SC~DOT,Cryptopia~SC~XMR,BitTrex~SC~ETH,Cryptopia~SC~BTC,Cryptopia~SC~UNO,Cryptopia~SC~LTC,Cryptopia~SC~FTC,Cryptopia~SC~DOGE,BitTrex~SC~BTC', 0),

SmartCoins always have 100% or more of their value backed by the BitShares core currency, BTS, to which they can be converted at any time at an exchange rate set by a trustworthy price feed. In all but the most extreme market conditions, SmartCoins are guaranteed to be worth at least their face value (and perhaps more, in some circumstances). Like any other cryptocurrency, SmartCoins are fungible, divisible, and free from any restrictions.</p><p>Decentralized Asset Exchange - A fast and fluid trading platform</p><p>BitShares provides a high-performance decentralized exchange, with all the features you would expect in a trading platform. It can handle the trading volume of the NASDAQ, while settling orders the second you submit them. With this kind of performance on a decentralized exchange, who needs risky centralized exchanges?</p><p>Industrial Performance and Scalability - Graphene is capable of 100,000 TPS when we pay for the network to go with it</p><p>High performance blockchain technology is necessary for cryptocurrencies and smart contract platforms to provide a viable alternative to existing financial platforms. BitShares is designed from the ground up to process more transactions every second than VISA and MasterCard combined. With Delegated Proof of Stake, the BitShares network can confirm transactions in an average of just 1 second, limited only by the speed of light.</p><p>Dynamic Account Permissions - Management for the corporate environment</p><p>BitShares designs permissions around people, rather than around cryptography, making it easy to use. Every account can be controlled by any weighted combination of other accounts and private keys. This creates a hierarchical structure that reflects how permissions are organized in real life, and makes multi-user control over funds easier than ever. Multi-user control is the single biggest contributor to security, and, when used properly, it can virtually eliminate the risk of theft due to hacking.</p><p>Recurring &amp; Scheduled Payments - Flexible withdrawal permissions</p><p>BitShares is the first smart contract platform with built-in support for recurring payments and subscription payments. This feature allows users to authorize third parties to make withdrawals from their accounts within certain limits. This is a convenient way to “set it and forget it” for monthly bills and subscriptions.</p><p>Referral Rewards Program - Network growth through adoption rewards</p><p>BitShares has an advanced referral program built directly into its software. Financial networks derive their value primarily from their network effect: more people on the same network increases the value of that network for everyone. BitShares capitalizes on this by rewarding those who sign up new users, and does so in a fully transparent and automated way.</p><p>User-Issued Assets - Regulation-compatible cryptoasset issuance</p><p>The BitShares platform provides a feature known as "user-issued assets" to help facilitate profitable business models for certain types of services. The term refers to a type of custom token registered on the platform, which users can hold and trade within certain restrictions. The creator of such an asset publically names, describes, and distributes its tokens, and can specify customized requirements, such as an approved whitelist of accounts permitted to hold the tokens, or the associated trading and transfer fees.</p><p>Collateralized Bond Market - Integrated peer-to-peer lending</p><p>The BitShares bond market is an investment marketplace accessible to anyone with an internet connection. In the bond market, you can earn interest with any asset, or take a short position using any other asset as collateral. (Coming Soon)</p><p>Stakeholder-Approved Project Funding - A self-sustaining funding model</p><p>BitShares is designed to be self funding and self-sustaining by giving the stakeholders the power to direct where blockchain reserves are spent. BitShares has a reserve pool of 1.2 billion BTS (about $8 million dollars) that automatically grows as transaction fees are collected and the share price rises. Each day, the blockchain is authorized to spend up to 432,000 BTS (about $77,000 per month), which is enough to hire a small team to maintain the network for years, even with no price appreciation.</p><p>Transferable Named Accounts - Easy and secure transactions</p><p>Named accounts enable users to easily remember and communicate their account information. We don&#39;t use IP addresses to browse the internet or numbers to identify our email, so why shouldn&#39;t we have human-friendly account names for our financial transactions?</p><p>Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus - A robust and flexible consensus protocol</p><p>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All network parameters, from fee schedules to block intervals and transaction sizes, can be tuned via elected delegates. Deterministic selection of block producers allows transactions to be confirmed in an average of just 1 second.

At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.</p><p>Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.</p><p><span>Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.</span></p><p><span>The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.</span></p><p><span>The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an "airdrop", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution.  Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.</span></p><p><span>Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.</span></p><p><span>Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.</span></p>', '<p><span>In addition to the technical features that make up the technology, Decred as a project introduces several development and governance features and proposals to ensure and steer long-term growth.

The PoW and PoS subsidies account for 60% and 30% of each total block subsidy, respectively. This system is based on that of MC2, which is very similar to, but developed independently from, Proof-of-Activity (PoA) by Iddo Bentov, Charles Lee, Alex Mizrahi and Meni Rosenfeld.</li><li>Cold staking and decentralized stake pooling - The ability to generate new coins without the risk of having your coins online when PoS mining. The PoS mining system has also been engineered with distributed, decentralized stake pooling in mind, so that even those with small amounts of stake can participate in network validation.</li><li>Internal voting system for the addition of new features and hard or soft fork selection - Both PoW and PoS miners can vote for features and issues through bit flags, providing a sensible mechanism for resolving disputes about the features of the blockchain.</li><li>Immutable transaction hashes ("transaction IDs") by separating transaction signatures from the rest of the transaction data - A permanent fix for transaction hash malleability has been implemented that prevents mutability of the transaction hash by separating it from its input signatures. This allows more efficient SPV validation. Fraud proofs have also been added.</li><li>Elliptic curve cryptography over secp256k1 with optional Curve25519 support - The Bitcoin scripting system has been modified to allow for simple, drop-in addition of new elliptical curve digital signature algorithms.</li><li>Schnorr signatures with threshold n-of-n support - In addition to supporting Schnorr signatures, groups of signers can now jointly sign transactions off-chain in constant size signatures, ensuring higher privacy and less blockchain bloat.</li><li>Script enhancements and new OP codes - New OP codes have been added to the existing Bitcoin scripting engine, and extensions for the plug-in use of future scripting engines have been added.</li><li>PoW mining using BLAKE256 hash algorithm - Inspired by Bernstein&#39;s Chacha stream cipher, SHA3 finalist BLAKE256 offers speed as well as high security.</li><li>Compatibility with Bitcoin transaction scripting system - Decred&#39;s scripting system has been derived from Bitcoin&#39;s with care in ensuring that all future updates to the Bitcoin transaction script will be easily extensible to Decred. Further, any newly created functionalities will also be devised with backwards compatibility with Bitcoin in mind.</li><li>Modularized, easy-to-use Golang btcsuite codebase - Thanks the to the codebase inherited from btcsuite, adding new features to the daemon or wallet will be facile. Decred will episodically sync updates from btcsuite, so that it benefits from the latest developments in Bitcoin.</li><li>Hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets - Wallets use a seed to deterministically generate addresses, so your wallet can be restored from a single BIP0032 seed.</li><li>Transaction expiration - Transactions have a new expiration field to prevent inclusion into the blockchain after a certain height.</li><li>Patches for intrinsic Bitcoin bugs - Extra push for multisignature scripts has been removed, SIGHASH_SINGLE behavior has been corrected.</li><li>Approximately 21 million coins - Exponential decay in subsidy or the number of coins generated per year.</li><li>Self-funded development via block subsidy - In order to have an ongoing source of funding for development work, a consensus rule has been added to allocate 10% of each block subsidy to a development organization. This entity is transparent and responsible for funding development work performed by current and new developers so that the project remains sustainable without a funding dependence on outside forces in the future.

Another small portion will be used for the maintenance of the platform; people donating their storage and bandwidth to the network. The majority of AMPs will go to those who are exposed to the content, compensating them for their time and attention.</li><li>Advertisers may use AMPs to created sponsored messages, reaching target audiences based on their interests and activity on the network. NOTE: A user of the system may always opt-out of receiving messages from specific advertisers, about specific topics, or altogether. Most of the AMPs used to advertise to you will be paid to you directly. This is a way to gain from your participation in the network and from the value you generate for it. The more you participate, the more the network is familiar with you and your interests, and the more influence you have on the network, the more your attention is worth! </li></ol><p><strong>Advertising on Synereo</strong></p><p>Facebook’s revenue for Q4 2014 was $3.85 Billion. This is the sum of money that was spent for Facebook content visibility alone, and does not account for resources invested in the creation of the content being advertized or the middlemen optimizing this process.</p><p>This grand economy relies on us - the users of the social network - in its entirety, but we do not share in its gains. Advertisers on these  networks are not happy campers, either. The advertising platforms, along with the service providers, are profiteering middlemen that take a major cut for supplying your attention to them.</p><p><strong>How is advertising on Synereo different? </strong></p><p>Synereo users are a real part of the advertising ecosystem rather than merely existing as pawns on someone else’s playing board. The advertisers’ funds do not remain in the hands of major corporations, but are delivered straight to potential customers around the globe as a form of compensation for their attention.</p><p>Synereo enables a two-way relationship between advertisers and prospects. Advertisers can target specific communities, contributing AMPs to causes, organizations or projects - and the people that enable them. On the other hand, an advertising campaign initiated by a popular  charity or cause can maintain minimal advertising spend while relying completely on "crowdsourced" AMPing by its supporters.</p><p>Synereo’s information flow logic greatly benefits advertisers who have committed to content excellence, increasing the spread of content engaged with by users recognized for their curation abilities and positive influence on the network; their ability to contribute to the attention economy underlying Synereo.</p><p>Similar to real-world viral campaigns, a well planned advertising effort would target influencers of the relevant topics and audiences to the campaign with excellent content that, if appreciated, will be distributed on Synereo organically rather than by “brute forcing” it with AMPs.</p><p>The lesser the quality of the content you see, the more you will be compensated for it!</p>', 927785472.00, NULL, 'CCEX~AMP~LTC,BitTrex~AMP~BTC,HitBTC~AMP~BTC,Cryptopia~AMP~DOGE,Cryptopia~AMP~BTC,Poloniex~AMP~BTC,CCEX~AMP~USD,CCEX~AMP~BTC,Cryptopia~AMP~UNO,Cryptopia~AMP~LTC', 0),

The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-proof Directed Acyclic Graph, with no fees on transactions &amp; no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second in the network. Instead, throughput grows in conjunction with activity in the network; the more activity, the faster the network. Unlike blockchain architecture, IOTA has no separation between users and validators; rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization. IOTA is initially focused on serving as the backbone of the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT). For a more in depth look at the technical design of IOTA read their <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf">https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf</a>. </span></span></p>', '<p><strong>Micro transactions </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time ever true micro and even nano-transactions are enabled due to the unique IOTA Tangle architecture, providing developers with a brand new set of tools for their applications in both IoT and Web.

The way to make money directly through Bitcoin is to predict its future price. WCG has an innovative mechanism to allow the transaction fees to be recycled, that is, all of the transaction fees included in that block of the forging account be rewarded. For the time being, there are only three ways to generate transaction fees: arbitrary messages, WCG transfers and aliases. But as WCG adds more features, each of the WCG accounts that are forged will continue to increase. As WCG has a practical mechanism to get more new features through its voting system, it is hoped that the community would agree to add more promising new features, to correspond to the increase of transaction fees and WCG&#39;s real interest rate. By combining all these features with a scalable framework, WCG has become the foundation of a well-established and mature peer-to-peer economy.
