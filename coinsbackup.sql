It was the first example of a cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography. \n\n The term ‘Bitcoin’ can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value) or it can refer to the technology (a distributed network that maintains the ledger of balances of the Bitcoin token). \n\n The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network. \n\n Bitcoin was first released as version 0.1 in January 2009, by Satoshi and was published on SourceForge, an online collaboration platform for developers. Anyone could download the source code and run it to join the network. Satoshi continued to write the Bitcoin code until 2010 and then handed it over to the open source community. The smallest unit of a Bitcoin is called a Satoshi after its founder(s) and represents one-hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin. The first Bitcoin was created when Satoshi mined the first block of the chain, known as the genesis block. \n\n There is said to be a limit of ₿21 million which can be mined. The supply is tightly controlled by an underlying algorithm. So, like gold, there is a limited and finite supply. Unlike the currencies issued by banks and governments, Bitcoin is not vulnerable to losing its value if the centralized issuing authority breaks down. The decentralized system can continue to operate as long as there are members in the network. \n\n The managing of transactions and the issuing of Bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source, its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. It is maintained by a group of volunteer coders and run by an open network of dedicated computers spread around the world. \n\n Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining, which comprises adding transaction records (or blocks of code) to Bitcoin\'s public ledger (or chain) of past transactions and keeping them in the queue. Blocks are chopped off as each transaction is finalized, codes deciphered, and Bitcoins passed or exchanged. Miners use special software to solve the math problems that keep the Bitcoin process secure and are issued a certain number of Bitcoins in return. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:19','2019-11-02 18:25:47',77301054437.29,360091640997.92,0.00,0.00,0.011350,0.129856,-0.149976,0.168675,2228.79149500),(1295,7605,2,'ETH','Ethereum',184.24094,1.00,0.017742,5293310131.57000,1.00,19971183543.13,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/eth.svg','1',1,'https://www.ethereum.org/','Ethash','PoW',' ','Ether (ETH) (Ξ) is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum network. Unlike Bitcoin, which aims to disrupt the banking system with its own digital currency, the Ethereum platform’s goal is to use blockchain to replace internet third parties, particularly those that store data, transfer mortgages, and keep track of complex financial instruments. \n\n Ethereum is made up of nodes run by volunteers across the world, the nodes form what has been described as a ‘world computer’, a decentralized mining network which is not governed by any third parties like, for example, servers and clouds are. \n\n The volunteers, or miners, use their own computational power (gas) to run the network. This involves passing blocks of code between each other and solving the mathematical problems that keep the code secure in exchange for Ether. The currency is listed on exchanges, and can only be used on the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to pay for gas and transaction fees. \n\n Ethereum is open-source, public, and highly programmable. Anyone can use or modify its software to build upon the computing platform and operating system. The platform gives developers the opportunity to build their own digital assets on the Ethereum infrastructure without having to create their own blockchain. This has given rise to hundreds of Ethereum blockchain based tokens (such as Binance Coin, Golem, and Basic Attention Coin). In 2017, at the height of crypto-mania Ethereum was leading blockchain platform for Initial Coin Offering  (ICO) projects, with over 50% market share. \n\n The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. He believed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. When he was unable to gain agreement, he devised a new platform with a more general scripting language. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:22','2019-11-02 18:25:47',29852791176.63,131841207161.38,0.00,0.00,-0.015692,0.053090,-0.170880,0.073987,-395.30461500),(1296,5031,3,'XRP','Ripple',0.29540,1.00,0.017545,1212344387.11000,1.00,12775632401.61,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/xrp.png','1',1,'https://ripple.com/','N/A','N/A','100000000000','XRP is the native digital asset of the Ripple platform. Ripple aims to connect banks and payment providers to provide a frictionless experience for sending and receiving money globally. It was originally designed as a day-to-day payment system, to speed up and reduce the costs of transactions, and provide a mediatory currency for exchanges and conversions with minimum commission. \n\n Software developer Ryan Fugger founded the original Ripple project in 2004. The core idea behind the protocol was a peer-to-peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks. Based on the premise that money is simply a bank’s promise of value, he aimed to create a monetary system where the promise of an individual held just as much weight. His concept was launched in 2005 as RipplePay, a financial service allowing users to extend credit lines to friends and family and make secure payments in traditional and online currencies. \n\n In 2012, Jed McCaleb, an American programmer and entrepreneur, along with Chris Larsen, an angel investor and startup executive, approached Ryan with a digital currency idea. Jed had been working on a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network. After discussions, Ryan handed over the reins to Jed and Chris, who co-founded the corporation OpenCoin, to develop the Ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. The company later changed its name to Ripple Labs. \n\n The Ripple platform is similar to Ethereum in that it has its a native currency (XRP) but is also open-source, allowing users to build their own assets and products on top of the existing platform. Ripple uses its proprietary patented technology, the ‘Ripple protocol consensus algorithm’ (RPCA), to verify transactions. It is argued that XRP is not technically a cryptocurrency because it is controlled by one company and transactions are processed by its network of approved validators. \n\n Ripple released its XRP token in January 2013. Like traditional cryptocurrencies, it is based on a public chain of cryptographic signatures. The company initially set the supply of XRP at 100 billion of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. On June 13, 2016, Ripple obtained a virtual currency license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the fourth company with a BitLicense. \n\n XRP enhances Ripple’s software by acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies, providing liquidity and speeding up cross-border transactions; however, it is not essential to the network and doesn’t have to be used. \n\n RippleNet is what Ripple calls the network of financial institutions using its products. There are three core segments: xCurrent for processing payments, xRapid to source liquidity, and xVia to connect to the network and send payments.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:24','2019-11-02 18:25:47',4595453668.80,24451566633.71,0.00,0.00,-0.022973,0.193966,-0.072313,0.017937,1634.81572500),(1297,202330,4,'BCH','Bitcoin Cash',292.03243,1.00,0.059977,1573853119.62000,1.00,5283220885.14,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bch.svg','1',1,'https://www.bitcoincash.org/','SHA-256','PoW','21000000','Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It’s a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency that requires no trusted third parties and no central bank. It was created in 2017 after the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues. The plan for a Bitcoin alternative was pushed through by Bitcoin activists, investors, entrepreneurs, developers, and largely China-based miners. It was considered to be one of the most successful hard-forks of the original Bitcoin. At the time of the fork, anyone owning Bitcoin was also given the same number of Bitcoin Cash units. \n\n Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed. Because the blocks are larger and contain more information, more computational power is needed to process (or mine) them. \n\n The larger block sizes remove the need for Segregated Witness (SegWit), a code adjustment used by Bitcoin to free up block space by removing certain parts of the transaction. One issue the community had with SegWit was that it forced transactions to happen off-chain, breaking the economic incentives to make Bitcoin work. By using larger blocks and speeding up transaction process time it is hoped that Bitcoin Cash will remain on-chain and still be able to compete with the number of transactions established by financial platforms like Visa or Paypal. \n\n The Bitcoin Cash protocol ensures there will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. The platform states that no transaction is too big or too small and that their network is on 24-hours a day, 365 days a year. \n\n By the end of 2018, Bitcoin Cash boasted sub-cent transaction fees, it was accepted at around 670 physical locations around the world, which (it claimed) made it the most secure and widely used digital currency on the planet.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:27','2019-11-02 18:25:47',5877627061.25,27914647970.13,0.00,0.00,0.096182,0.315853,-0.128203,0.368017,8808.12874000),(1298,3808,5,'LTC','Litecoin',58.84161,1.00,0.017396,1684587756.63000,1.00,3741964528.21,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ltc.svg','1',1,'https://litecoin.org/','Scrypt','PoW','84000000','Litecoin (LTC) (Ł) is a is a рееr-tо-рееr сrурtосurrеnсу аnd open ѕоurсе software project.

Litecoin enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. \n\n The coin is designed for everyday use, pumping out four times as many coins as Bitcoin, in an effort to keep the digital currency from becoming scarce and too expensive. Transactions are also said to be four times faster. There is a limit of 84 million Litecoins. \n\n Litecoin was released on October 7, 2011, via an open-source client on GitHub, under MIT/X11 lісеnѕеѕ which are permissive forms of open software licenses with limited restrictions on reuse. The Litecoin Network went live on October 13, 2011, and is described as a fork of the Bitcoin Core client. In addition to trading and purchasing Litecoin, it is possible to mine it, which essentially means providing the network with computational power in exchange for the digital currency. As of 2018, miners were awarded 25 new Litecoins per block, an amount which will get halved roughly every 4 years (every 840,000 blocks). \n\n In May 2017, Litecoin became the first of the top 5 (by market cap) cryptocurrencies to adopt Segregated Witness (known as SegWit), which is a soft fork allowing optimal data transmission while bypassing certain protocol restrictions. This (amongst other things) not only speeds up transactions but allows for larger block sizes. \n\n The currency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee and Engineering Director at Coinbase. Litecoin is his second attempt at a cryptocurrency, having launched one called Fairbrix which didn’t get off the ground due to technical problems. In 2017 Charlie sold or donated all of his Litecoins except for a few he kept as collectibles. He took the decision not to hold a significant amount of the tokens to avoid a conflict of interest. \n\n The Litecoin blockchain is the largest global scrypt based network, operating with 100% uptime since 2011 securing and transacting billions of dollars of value. Scrypt is an algorithm specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory. \n\n Litecoin was created to make mining as accessible and democratized as possible, rather than being monopolized by companies with huge mining capabilities. Since the time between mining blocks is small, more miners have the opportunity to mine blocks and earn mining rewards. At the beginning of 2018, 14,400 Litecoins were being mined a day, the maximum number possible.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:29','2019-11-02 18:25:48',10555608813.70,43785912241.86,0.00,0.00,0.003450,0.043945,-0.366554,0.095246,-2254.27287500),(1299,171986,6,'USDT','Tether',1.00202,1.00,-0.000344,18131095652.31000,1.00,4116343074.69,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/usdt.svg','1',1,'https://tether.to/','N/A','N/A',' ','Tether (₮) (USD₮) is a cryptocurrency with digital tokens designed to replicate the value of the United States Dollar. The theory is that this provides protection from the volatility of cryptocurrencies, so 1 USD₮ will always be worth $1. To achieve this Tether claims to have each token backed 100% by actual assets in the platform’s reserve account. \n\n The origins of Tether came from a whitepaper published online in January 2012, in which software developer J.R. Willett described the possibility of building new currencies on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Credited with ‘inventing the ICO’ to fund the project, Willett went on to implement his idea in the form of the ‘Mastercoin’. The Mastercoin protocol became the technological foundation of the Tether platform. Tethers exist on blockchains using the Omni Protocol, and as ERC20 tokens. \n\n Two original members of the Mastercoin Foundation, Brock Pierce and Craig Sellars, became co-founders of Tether. Former child actor, Brock was a minor partner in a digital entertainment network that raised $88 million in venture capital in the 1990s. In 2013, he joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which was reported to have raised $85 million in two venture funds by October 2017. \n\n Co-founder Craig Sellars started his career as a UX developer, worked in various engineering positions before presiding over a number of wireless operations. His first foray into the blockchain space was at Tether, later becoming CTO of exchange Bitfinnex for a year and a half. Since then he has held a variety of roles as co-founder, technologist, facilitator, and advisor for several blockchain projects and companies including vAtomic, Unsung, Fuzo, Factom, Synereo, Tau Chain and the MaidSafe Foundation. He is the founder of the Omni Foundation which developed the protocol used by Tether. \n\n Reeve Collins, the third co-founder, launched several ventures before Tether, including Traffic Marketplace, one of the first online ad networks to be acquired by Vivendi Universal, RedLever, a branded entertainment studio, acquired by Adconion Media Group, and Pala Interactive, where he secured $70 million to create a legal, real-money gambling site in the US. \n\n Tether was incorporated in Hong Kong with offices in Switzerland. In January 2015, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex enabled Tether trading on its platform. Bitfinex officials Philip Potter and Giancarlo Devasini were responsible for setting up Tether Holdings Limited in the British Virgin Islands in 2014. A spokesperson for Bitfinex and Tether stated that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde was also the CEO of both firms at the time.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:32','2019-11-02 18:25:48',85794388466.63,384420872405.21,0.00,0.00,0.001973,0.000439,0.000389,-0.000099,29.22299500),(1300,166503,7,'EOS','EOS',3.33508,1.00,0.010290,1549952827.60000,1.00,3129930767.97,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/eos.svg','1',1,'https://eos.io/','DPoS','DPoS',' ','EOS is the native cryptocurrency that powers the blockchain protocol EOSIO, a network, and platform for the deployment of decentralized applications built on Ethereum. Unofficially EOS stands for ‘Ethereum Operating System’. \n\n The protocol is a sidechain solution developed on top of the Ethereum network to overcome scalability issues. Sidechains allow developers to process transactions off-chain, only adding to the public ledger as needed, thereby avoiding the process bottlenecks. The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and is capable of conducting millions of transactions per second. \n\n EOSIO was developed by the private company block.one, which is registered in the Cayman Islands. Its first whitepaper was published in 2017, and its open-source software was released on June 1, 2018. It aims to be the first decentralized operating system that provides a development environment for decentralized applications (dApps) like BitShares, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX), and Steemit, a social network with monetary incentives. \n\n The EOS utility token is supported by wallets and exchanges that support the ERC-20 protocol (a series of functions and events that an Ethereum token contract has to implement). The blockchain platform’s constitution states that any EOSIO members who don’t use their EOS for three years could have their accounts terminated. Block.one says this measure is to encourage the platform to be used for its intended utility i.e. building dApps and communities by staking tokens for RAM, CPU, Network, and eventually storage. \n\n Block.one’s software uses a decentralized consensus algorithm called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS). It was created by block.one’s co-founder Dan Larimer as an improvement to Bitcoin’s ‘Proof of Work’ system. DPOS uses less electricity, is faster, and is less centralized. \n\n Dan was formerly a software engineer on America’s military-industrial complex working on defense projects such as drones and unmanned vehicles. After a crisis of conscience, he left to create systems that provide ‘life, liberty, and property for mankind.’ EOSIO is the third blockchain platform he has co-founded. Larimer developed the blockchain technology Graphene, and founded Steemit, a social network which uses blockchain technology to reward users. DPOS also has a number of applications and has been used in everything from Steem (the blockchain used by Steemit), EOS, List, Ark, and more. \n\n Fellow co-founder Brendan Blumer began his journey into virtual assets aged 14, selling characters, magic weapons, and houses in online games such as Everquest and World of Warcraft. His first company, Gamecliff, created when he was fresh out of college, was acquired by Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE) in 2005. Two years later he founded The Accounts Network, a company that sold in-game MMORPG avatars. In 2010, Blumer further launched Okay.com, an enterprise data sharing platform for real estate brokers in Asia. \n\n In June 2017, EOSIO opened its initial coin offering (ICO), raising a record $4.1 billion in just one year making it the most successfully recorded ICO at the time. During this period, 1,000,000,000 EOS was distributed with 10% being withheld by block.one. \n\n In 2018 block.one announced a partnership with blockchain veterans Michael Cao and Winnie Liu to form a new $200 million joint venture fund, EOS Global. The fund will make strategic investments in Asia-focused projects that utilize EOSIO. \n\n In the same year, the company announced a number of other strategic partnerships including a $100 million joint venture fund with FINLAB AG, to support projects that stimulate EOSIO innovation in Europe. It also partnered with Galaxy Digital to deploy capital for future investments through it\'s $325 million EOSIO Ecosystem Fund and created a $50 million fund with TOMORROW BLOCKCHAIN OPPORTUNITIES.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:36','2019-11-02 18:25:48',10836582761.42,36936686479.44,0.00,0.00,0.019798,0.137809,-0.210202,0.164128,1653.79102500),(1301,204788,8,'BNB','Binance Coin',20.25003,1.00,0.016643,183281051.57000,1.00,3149623398.43,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bnb.svg','1',1,'https://www.binance.com/en','N/A','N/A','187536713','Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency issued by the popular trading platform Binance. The coin runs natively on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the ERC20 technical token standard. It is classified as a utility token and can be used on the Binance exchange. \n\n In July 2017, Binance held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB which helped it to raise $15 million. During the ICO process, the company offered 10% of the total number of coins (BNB 20 million) to angel investors, 40% (BNB 80 million) to the founding team, and the remaining 50% (BNB 100 million) to other participants. Holders of the BNB coin are referred to as Binancians. \n\n According to Binance’s whitepaper, half the funds raised during the ICO were earmarked for branding and marketing, one-third were used to build the Binance platform and perform necessary upgrades to the Binance ecosystem, and 15% were kept in reserve for emergencies. \n\n The token was established with a total supply of 200 million, and a key influence on BNB’s value is Binance’s strategy to buy back a percentage of the coins and ‘burn’ them. Burning coins means taking them out of circulation and permanently destroying them. The benefit is that it increases the value of the remaining coins left in circulation. Binance has stated that it will use 20% of its profits from every quarter to buy back and burn BNB until the supply of the coin is 50% of the original amount (100 million BNB). Every buy-back transaction conducted by Binance is announced via the blockchain for transparency. \n\n The BNB token itself has multiple uses, essentially being the underlying gas that powers the Binance ecosystem. For the first year, Binance offered a 50% discount on its exchange trading fees using the coin. In its whitepaper, Binance has outlined plans to offer annually decreasing discounts on fees for BNB users until its fifth year of operation. \n\n There have been several other real-world use cases for BNB since its launch. In 2017 Monaco, which offers a Visa-branded credit card that converts cryptocurrencies into fiat payments, announced its plans to support BNB.  It can also be used on Uplive, Asia’s premier high-end live video platform. \n\n BNB has become more usable for goods and services in a growing number of brick and mortar establishments around the world. Australian startup TravelbyBit, for example, has equipped more than 150 establishments, including Brisbane Airport, with the ability to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies including BNB. \n\n The token is also being used as a payment method on platforms made by blockchain startups such as crypto point-of-sale solutions provider Pundi X, blockchain payments company Crypto.com, and CoinPayments, which acts as a crypto point of sale for millions of online vendors around the globe. Binance also states that about 9 in 10 of its employees receive a portion of their salaries in the BNB token.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:38','2019-11-02 18:25:48',1068962130.99,5261158563.89,0.00,0.00,0.072052,0.292765,-0.261898,0.116962,3055.41518000),(1302,5038,10,'XMR','Monero',62.67232,1.00,0.032908,150505692.35000,1.00,1083491257.54,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/xmr.svg','1',1,'https://www.getmonero.org/','CryptoNight-V7','PoW',' ','Monero (XMR) is a secure, private, and untraceable digital currency. Although it offers the option of transparency, it is typically known for its use of privacy technologies such as ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obscure the origins, amounts, and destinations of transactions. \n\n You can buy Monero from an exchange or from an individual. Alternatively, you can mine Monero to get coins from the block reward. Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Unlike Bitcoin, where people can see exactly how much money is being sent from one user to another, Monero hides this information to protect user privacy. Monero also features a dynamic block size and dynamic fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work, and a tail coin emission. \n\n Monero’s Kovori is an anonymized router which integrates I2P technology and has been under development since 2015. The project will improve the privacy of the network by hiding the IP addresses of those who wish to interact with the Monero blockchain. \n\n Due to the stringent privacy features, Monero experienced rapid market capitalization growth in 2016, far surpassing that of other cryptocurrencies. This was reportedly due to its adoption by the darknet market and rightwing extremists. \n\n Monero is an open source project maintained by a group of core developers and a community of open source contributors and researchers. There are no public details about the founders in the public space; the first whitepaper with a focus on the CryptoNote protocol was written by Nicolas van Saberhagen (assumed to be a pseudonym). In 2018, it was widely reported in the crypto press that Monero had 7 members, 49 developers, and 3 researchers, with the unofficial figurehead of ‘pseudonymous Luigi’. \n\n In 2017, there was some controversy about a Javascript mining software called Coinhive which generates a script allowing websites or apps to access a visitor\'s Central Processing Unit and mine Monero. The site or app owner gets a percentage of the coins mined while visitors are consuming content on their site. Coinhive did not require the third-parties to tell visitors that their computers were being accessed and their electricity consumed in exchange for a site visit. \n\n Monero suffered another PR issue in 2018 when hackers took advantage of weak code to manipulate the amount of XMR shown in a wallet, before convincing exchanges to pay out. \n\n A team of researchers from a broad collection of institutions, including Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, Boston University, MIT, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, also claim that a token’s movements on Monero are not as obscured as they seem and that it is possible to extract information on individual transactions.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:41','2019-11-02 18:25:48',337262498.66,2196928899.00,0.00,0.00,0.027058,0.113911,-0.287454,0.159056,766.08115000),(1303,321992,11,'ADA','Cardano',0.04230,1.00,0.016389,32958690.02000,1.00,1096757663.60,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ada.svg','1',1,'https://www.cardano.org/en/home/','Ouroboros','PoS','45000000000','Launched in 2017, Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project which is fully open source and was built to support the creation of decentralized financial applications (dApps). It claims to have more advanced features than any protocol developed and to have the first currency to evolve out of scientific philosophy, academic theory, and peer-reviewed research. Appropriately, the platform takes its name from Gerolamo Cardano, an Italian polymath who is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the Renaissance. \n\n The native cryptocurrency of Cardano is called Ada (ADA), named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician (and daughter of Lord Byron) who is often referred to as the first computer programmer. The currency is integrated natively into Cardano’s settlement layer, making it an essential part of the platform; however, this is something that Cardano reportedly intends to supersede. \n\n Ada enables users to send value over the internet securely and quickly. After launch, Ada had one official wallet called Daedalus. The circulating supply of Ada was 25 billion in 2018, with a maximum potential supply of 45 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Ada offers the ability to stake coins (essentially earn interest on holdings); however, due to the limited number of coins, the block reward is expected to drop over time. \n\n Cardano is spearheaded by three entities, each of which is separately owned and managed. The first is the non-profit Cardano Foundation, an independent body based in Switzerland with core responsibilities to help supervise the development of Cardano and its ecosystem. The second entity is Input Output HK (IOHK) which is contracted to design and build Cardano. The third is Emurgo, a Japanese incubator acting as the for-profit arm working to boost the Cardano ecosystem through commercial ventures. \n\n Rather than stemming from a whitepaper, Cardano is the result of a number of academic papers. The goal being that considerable peer review efforts via academic partnerships will ensure that Cardano is built and operated using qualitative ‘high assurance code.’ Cardano is being developed using Haskell, a programming language unique to the platform, featuring a high degree of fault tolerance. Smart contracts are created in another functional language called Plutus which enables stricter contracts. \n\n Like Ethereum, Cardano is a smart contract platform. It features a unique consensus algorithm (called Ouroboros) that validates transactions without high energy costs, aiming to dramatically increase transactions per second while boosting computational power. The platform is considered ‘third-generation’ and is intended to improve on second-generation platforms like Ethereum and first-generation platforms like Bitcoin. This is partly achieved by employing the ‘Ouroboros proof-of-stake’ model rather than a proof-of-work model. \n\n Both Ethereum and Cardano (or IOHK, the entity that designs and builds Cardano) were co-founded by Charles Hoskinson. Charles is a Colorado-based technology entrepreneur and mathematician who also founded a third cryptocurrency-related start-up – Invictus Innovations. \n\n IOHK’s second founder, Jeremy Wood, was formerly Manager of Operations at Ethereum, which he left to consult various entities on cryptocurrencies before co-founding Input Output. \n\n A key focus of Cardano is to use its coin and technology to provide assistance in countries with an acute lack of access to banking. Cardano has explicitly stated that its currency’s ultimate value will be based upon hard work, real-world use, and the utility of the platform, not on making day traders rich.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:44','2019-11-02 18:25:48',303525429.95,1971746472.50,0.00,0.00,-0.001583,0.101906,0.000000,0.086646,2474.63027500),(1304,4614,12,'XLM','Stellar',0.07026,1.00,0.022378,200556590.07000,1.00,1408955863.88,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/xlm.svg','1',1,'https://www.stellar.org/','N/A','N/A',' ','Stellar is a platform that connects banks, payments systems and people, helping them to move money across borders at almost no cost. It acts as a bridge facilitating the low-cost trading of fiat currencies, particularly in cases where there might not be a large direct market. \n\n The native asset of the Stellar network is the Lumen (XLM). Lumens are used to pay transaction fees on the platform and act as a security measure that mitigates DoS attacks that attempt to generate large numbers of transactions or consume large amounts of space in the ledger. The asset also plays an anti-spam role, as all user accounts must hold a minimum of 0.5 Lumen, discouraging abandoned accounts and ensuring that they all have economic utility. \n\n In 2014, when the network launched, the native asset was also called ‘Stellar’ but was renamed ‘Lumen’ in 2015 to prevent confusion. The supply of Lumens is governed by strict protocol-level rules. At launch 100 billion were created and every year new Lumens are added to the network at an inflation rate of 1%. \n\n The platform and development of the network are run by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit and non-stock fund. The founders of the fund can neither benefit from its operation or from the sale of its shares. \n\n After launch, the foundation announced its intentions to distribute 50% of the total number of Lumens to each unique individual who signed up through an invitation. Partners such as businesses, governments, institutions, or nonprofit organizations that contribute to the growth and adoption of the Stellar ecosystem were allocated 25%. A further 20% was given away to Bitcoin and XRP holders over two distribution rounds in 2017, and 5% is reserved for operational expenses. As of January 2018, 8 billion Lumens had been given away. \n\n Stellar is an open-source, distributed payments infrastructure, meaning that anyone can build an app or financial product on top of it. It was developed to provide the opportunity for new organizations to extend financial access to unserved communities by ensuring participants record transactions correctly. IBM’s blockchain division, for example, partnered with Stellar in 2017 and use Lumens as a unit of account for their banking payments infrastructure. \n\n Like all blockchain platforms, Stellar consists of a number of servers (or nodes) around the world which keep a record of every account and transaction in the network and store the records in a ledger. The properties of the ledger can only be changed when all servers reach a consensus that the change meets the protocol criteria. \n\n The company was founded by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. Jed is an American programmer and entrepreneur who founded and served as the CTO of Ripple until 2013 and is known for creating the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. In January 2018, McCaleb\'s Ripple token ownership was reported to be worth $20 billion, putting him in 40th place in Forbes\' list of world\'s richest people. \n\n After beginning her career as an attorney, Joyce was a venture capitalist at Freestyle Capital. She co-founded SimpleHoney, a mobile commerce startup, and was CEO of Soompi, an English language website providing coverage of Korean pop culture. She resigned as Executive Director of Stellar in 2016. \n\n Stellar was based on the initial Ripple protocol and model. After systemic problems with Ripple’s existing consensus algorithm were discovered, Stellar created an updated version of the protocol with a new consensus algorithm. Both platforms have many common traits, however Stellar is known to be more opensource and decentralized.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:47','2019-11-02 18:25:48',214201254.96,1010342097.01,0.00,0.00,0.066155,0.198719,-0.142600,0.120092,3330.16581000),(1305,310829,15,'TRX','TRON',0.02007,1.00,0.028455,303518487.55000,1.00,1338229750.11,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/trx.svg','1',1,'https://tron.network/','N/A','DPoS',' ','Tronix (TRX) is the native currency of the Tron blockchain platform. The platform was designed to form the foundation of a decentralized entertainment ecosystem. This will allow content creators to connect directly with consumers, cutting out middlemen and removing the barriers to independent producers seeking distribution channels. It claims users will benefit from the data they create, unlike traditional social platforms that harvest your data and monetize it. \n\n Founded by a Singapore-based non-profit, the Tron Foundation not only aims to capitalize on the global entertainment industry, but, according to its whitepaper, sees its protocol as an enabler for live social broadcasting, gambling applications, gaming, and social or dating interactions. \n\n Tronix can be used by content consumers to pay for the content they want to access on the Tron network. These coins then go to the content producers’ accounts, where they can be exchanged to other cryptocurrencies, or used to pay for blockchain services. At launch, TRX was an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet; in June 2018, when the Tron mainnet launched, the ERC-20 tokens were migrated to the native TRX coin (TRON20) at a 1:1 ratio. This event is referred to as the Tron Independence Day. \n\n An apparent benefit of the TRX is its speed. The website states that TRX consistently handles 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), 24/7 compared to 25 TPS for Ether and 3-6 TPS for Bitcoin. Another benefit is that Tron removes the complication of building a new blockchain protocol from scratch by providing one on which developers can create and deploy their own decentralized applications (dApps). \n\n Tron’s mainnet aims to ‘heal the internet’ through free and uncontrolled data, a content ecosystem where users can obtain digital assets from content spreading, a personal ICO feature with the ability to distribute digital assets, the infrastructure to allow distributed digital assets exchanges (such as games), and market forecasting. \n\n In 2019, Tron had dual headquarters in Beijing and San Francisco, and was planning to establish more overseas offices in preparation for rapid expansion. Its founder, Justin Sun, worked for two years as the chief representative and advisor to Ripple in greater China, helping it with its first successful round of funding. He also the founded PEIWO, a mobile social networking and voice streaming app. \n\n As of January 2019, around 98% of the 100 billion circulating supply of ERC-20 TRX had been burnt (destroyed) by the Tron foundation and its community.

Launched in 2014, it was originally released as XCoin (XCO) before changing its name to ‘Darkcoin’. It was one of the first digital currencies to feature a decentralized blockchain governance system. It rebranded again in March 2015; its new name is an amalgamation of the words ‘digital cash’. \n\n The coin was created as a result of a Bitcoin fork in an attempt to improve on efficiency, speed, and anonymity. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, claiming to be the perfect option for people who are not interested in cryptocurrency. Transactions have low fees and are much faster than Bitcoin. \n\n Dash coins are obtainable through mining, running the network as a masternode, or by exchanging them for other tokens and fiat currencies. Anyone can form a masternode if they hold 1000 Dash in collateral. If a miner is willing to perform advanced functions (such as increased privacy and instant transactions) they can earn a 45% block reward. In April 2018, Dash\'s market capitalization was around $4.3 billion, it was one of the top 12 cryptocurrencies and its peer-to-peer network was one of the largest in the world. \n\n The founder of Dash is crypto developer Evan Duffield who began to work in programming when he was still in high school. He has held positions at a number of tech firms including Warped AI, iAcquire, Wells Fargo, and Verizon Wireless. Evan became enthralled with crypto after reading Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper. When he realized the future importance of fintech, he went on to gain a series 65 license allowing him to become an investment advisor in the US. \n\n Dash is designed to have a total supply of 18 million coins with the circulating supply of Dash in 2018 hovering at around 7.4 million. The coin is set to reach its supply limit in the year 2300. Dash has a variable block reward which decreases at a 7.1 % rate each year. The average block mining time is 2.5 minutes on the Dash blockchain, which makes it four times faster than Bitcoin. \n\n Using a coin mixing service called CoinJoin, Dash allows you to send your funds privately by mixing it between several other transactions, making it harder to identify the specifics. For a slightly higher processing fee, it offers ‘Instant Send’ transactions (processed within 1.5 seconds). \n\n Dash also offers a shares scheme where users can allocate their coins to help incentivize masternodes, while receiving up to 8% of interest a year. This compares to traditional banks which offer around 0.8% return. \n\n Dash is listed on a large number of exchanges and it possible to exchange it for goods and services at a number of online organizations including online casinos, marketing agencies, and coffee merchants. Most sellers are based in the US and Europe. Over 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, Dash became extremely popular in Venezuela where the hyperinflation of the local currency had left locals unable to afford basic items or food.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:53','2019-11-02 18:25:48',1163709435.77,5582087116.96,0.00,0.00,-0.000711,0.037077,-0.323606,0.066949,-2368.48465000),(1307,5324,17,'ETC','Ethereum Classic',4.98828,1.00,0.026763,372505906.90000,1.00,572465835.12,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/etc.svg','1',1,'https://ethereumclassic.org/','Ethash','PoW','210000000','Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a second generation blockchain, a network, a community, and a cryptocurrency. In addition to allowing people to send amounts of value to each other, ETC allows for complex contracts that operate autonomously and cannot be modified or censored. \n\n Both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum (ETH) have a value token called ‘Ether’, which can be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed on the Ethereum Platform. \n\n The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015. \n\n Two years after Ethereum’s launch there was a hack which caused a split in the community, often described as a ‘battle of ethics and ideology’. The victims were investors in a fund called the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which was launched by the Ethereum community as a decentralized investment fund for smart contract projects. \n\n Instead of a few venture capitalist partners making decisions on which projects to invest in, DAO holders were promised a voting input in investments. The project was so popular that the ICO attracted over $150 million in funding. \n\n In June, 3.6 million Ether (worth approximately $50 million USD) was taken from accounts in the DAO and moved to another account without the owners\' consent, exploiting one of several vulnerabilities that had already been flagged by community members. A loophole in the code allowed someone to repeat a refund request multiple times for the same DAO tokens before the transaction could be registered on the system. The recursive function was able to run until a third of DAO’s funds were siphoned off. \n\n Ironically the stolen currency can never be spent because the code in the blockchain would allow them to be traced. Following the hack, there was a majority decision that Ethereum needed to fork and create something new from scratch. \n\n The new protocol retained the original name Ethereum (ETH) because of the amount of community support for the fork. It functions on a brand new blockchain, and the vast majority of miners, users, and protocol from the previous version of Ethereum use this new version. In this sense, Ethereum functions more like a software company. ETH’s primary value is in its use case scenarios and community support. The Ethereum Alliance, for example, consists of billion-dollar firms such as Accenture, JP Morgan, Microsoft, and UBS. The Ethereum chain that forked (ETH) was able to retrieve the $50 million that was hacked and return it to investors. \n\n Ethereum Classic (ETC) has a new name but is the original version of the Ethereum protocol using the original blockchain.

It claims to be the world’s first self-evolving blockchain and its main premise is the ability to integrate new technology into the ledger as it becomes available. Its native utility token XTZ (known as Tez or Tezzies) launched on June 24, 2017, at a price of approximately $3 per coin. \n\n Self-amendment allows Tezos to upgrade itself without having to split or fork the network into two different blockchains. This avoids divisions in the community that can disrupt the network, reduces execution costs for upgrades, and allows future innovation to be seamlessly implemented. \n\n The Tezos blockchain protocol is a delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) system that supports Turing complete smart contracts. It is implemented in OCaml, a functional programming language that offers speed, an unambiguous syntax and semantics, and formal proofs of correctness. \n\n Tezos allows all stakeholders to participate in the on-chain governance of the protocol through an election cycle, which provides a formal and systematic procedure to reach agreements on amendments. Upgrades to Tezos are staged through a testing environment to allow stakeholders to recall potentially problematic updates should they arise. Tezos developers can propose protocol upgrades in exchange for contribution rewards. \n\n The PoS system means that all validations are conducted virtually, not physically, and does not require mining hardware and large amounts of electricity; the process is called ‘baking’ as opposed to ‘mining.’ You can acquire XTZ through the ‘baking’ model by signing and appending a block of transactions to the Tezos blockchain. \n\n There are two types of accounts that exist on the Tezos blockchain: originated accounts and implicit accounts. Originated accounts can’t take part in the baking process, and must instead assign a delegate (with an implicit account) to bake on their behalf. Implicit accounts can participate in the Tezos baking process, as long as the account has been registered as a delegate. \n\n XTZ holders of both kinds of accounts can participate in the consensus mechanisms that keep the chain functioning and receive rewards for doing so through the ‘delegating’ process. A standard unit of Tezos for baking is a roll of 10,000 coins. A baker stands a higher chance of being able to bake or endorse a block if they have a larger number of rolls. An originated account holder who delegates coins to a baker receives an annualized yield (like interest). \n\n The project is the vision of Arthur Breitman, a French-born mathematician and computer scientist with a background working for large corporates like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The project’s co-founder and Breitman’s wife, Kathleen, has previous experience in the financial sector, having previously worked for renowned companies such as Bridgewater Associates and R3. \n\n After failing to raise funds from banks and investors through the USA registered company Dynamic Ledger Solution, Inc. (DLS), the Breitmans raised funds through an ICO in July 2017. It was an unprecedented success, raising 66,000 Bitcoin and 361,000 Ether (equal at the time to $232 million) in the space of only 13 days. \n\n This fundraising was soon followed by several controversies, including internal board member disputes and several class-action lawsuits. The Tezos foundation, however, went on to successfully launch its beta network in 2018. The first exchanges to list XTZ for trade were Gate.io and HitBTC, where it quickly became a popular coin. \n\n In 2018, Tezos announced funding for TezTech, a Tezos-focused software shop with several projects underway, including a trustless scaling and custody solution, and API and software libraries.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:08:58','2019-11-02 18:25:48',21747904.64,111565423.25,0.00,0.00,0.003977,-0.068974,-0.393765,-0.009454,-5413.31017000),(1309,27368,20,'NEO','NEO',11.12150,1.00,0.051845,422364472.70000,1.00,784497260.23,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/neo.svg','1',1,'https://neo.org/','N/A','N/A','100000000','NEO is a non-profit community driven blockchain platform designed to create a scalable network of decentralized applications (dApps). Sometimes dubbed the Chinese Ethereum, it was originally launched in 2014, under the brand name of Antshares. Its dual-layered blockchain was developed by Onchain DNA, with a protocol that is said to fix many of Ethereum’s scalability issues. It rebranded as NEO in 2017. \n\n A self-proclaimed ‘smart economy’, NEO uses blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets and automate their management through smart contracts; contracts are developer friendly and use mainstream programming languages, such as C#, Python, Go, and Javascript. \n\n NEO and GAS (or neoGAS) are the two proprietary tokens used on the platform. NEO is the shares token, while GAS is the fuel token; the total supply of both is 100 million. Every NEO token gives the holder the right to manage the network and vote in discussions regarding bookkeeping and NEO network parameter changes. NEO cannot be mined, because it represents a share of the NEO market it is technically classed as a security. The minimum unit of NEO is one, and tokens cannot be subdivided. \n\n GAS is used to pay for NEO blockchain service fees such as the storage of tokens and smart contracts. To register or change assets on the blockchain, you need to acquire GAS. It acts as an economic incentive for bookkeepers and prevents the abuse of resources. GAS can be traded on exchanges and has a minimum unit of 0.00000001. NEO holders earn GAS when there are new registrations and changes in assets, rather than profiting through transaction fees (which are currently set at zero). This strengthens the eco-system by encouraging NEO holders to focus on getting more people to join the blockchain. \n\n In April 2016, the NEO released a whitepaper on a new type of consensus protocol (dBFT – delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance), which was the first to come from China. The protocol allows NEO to maintain a transaction speed of 1,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum’s 15 TPS. \n\n NEO held its ICO between July 1-9, 2016.

This network allows smart contracts on the Ethereum platform to securely connect to external data sources, payment systems, and application program interfaces (APIs) that exist outside the blockchain.\n\nAlthough smart contracts (agreements between two parties written in computer code) have tremendous potential, the underlying consensus mechanisms of blockchain technology make it so smart contracts are unable to communicate with external data systems.  Some smart contracts can’t execute without off-chain information (e.g., a price fluctuation for a specific asset).  To solve this issue, oracles are used.\n\nAn oracle finds and verifies real-world events and submits this data to smart contracts on the blockchain.  Although oracles help, they also present another point of concern: oracles are centralized third-party sources.  A user must trust that the oracle is providing accurate data.  This is called the “oracle problem.”\n\nSmartContract (a San Francisco based fintech company) launched Chainlink in June of 2017 in response to the “oracle problem.” Originally called SmartContract Oracle, Chainlink is a blockchain middleware that connects smart contracts across blockchains and allows them to access off-chain information from multiple oracles in the network. \n\nInstead of relying on a single oracle to provide smart contracts with external data, Chainlink’s decentralized network of independent nodes can perform computations to determine the accuracy of off-chain data from several oracles before it is passed to a smart contract.\n\nThe ChainLink network uses Link, an ERC-20 token, as an incentive for Node operators to retrieve data from off-chain data feeds, structure data into readable formats on the blockchain, execute off-chain computation, and maintain uptime guarantees. \n\nSmartContract was cofounded in 2014 by Sergey Nazarov (CEO).  Before starting SmartContract, Sergey founded Secure Asset Exchange and CryptoMail. \n\nChainLink’s ICO was held in September of 2017 and raised $32 million USD. \n\nChainlink launched on Ethereum’s mainnet on May 30, 2019. \n\nAccording to SmartContract, Chainlink has partnerships with Google Cloud, Oracle, and SWIFT.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:05','2019-11-02 18:25:48',228444731.97,1305626978.56,0.00,0.00,-0.032171,0.390398,0.077351,0.148709,7148.97212500),(1311,41192,24,'MKR','Maker',523.98458,1.00,-0.000908,3656190.48000,1.00,523984579.27,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/mkr.png','1',1,'https://makerdao.com/en/','N/A','N/A',' ','Maker (MKR) is a proprietary utility token for the Maker platform operated by MakerDAO. It forms the basis of a blockchain-based banking system that simplifies international payments and peer-to-peer transfers. The main purpose of MKR is to govern the Maker Platform and to maintain the stability of the Dai stablecoin (DAI) through a ‘collateralized debt position’ (CDP) contract. \n\n DAI is a cryptocurrency that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral. Its value is stable relative to the US Dollar (USD) but is collateral-backed by Ethereum rather than a fiat currency; DAI is an Ethereum ERC20 token and  every DAI is worth $1. The coin is soft-pegged to the USD and can be moved to another currency should the US economy collapse. \n\n DAI was developed as a solution to the volatility of popular digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), which MakerDAO claims are impossible to use as everyday currencies due to their massive price fluctuations. Through smart contracts and MKR, the platform uses interest rate mechanisms to stabilize DAI’s price. \n\n DAI is created through borrowing against collateral on the Maker platform. To acquire DAI you need to leverage some of your ETH and lock it up as collateral in a CDP contract. At any time you can reclaim that collateral by returning the borrowed DAI plus an accumulated fee. \n\n Maker supports DAI’s stability directly by liquidating CDPs if the price of DAI’s underlying collateral (ETH) falls too far. This process is carried out by keepers; that is, traders that use programs to scan the blockchain for risky CDP’s. When a CDP is liquidated, the keeper receives a small reward for triggering the liquidation process; any excess proceeds are returned to the original borrower. \n\n MKR is a token that has governance rights over the Maker smart contracts. For instance, the collateralization rate of CDPs is set by a vote of MKR holders. In return for regulating the system, MKR holders are rewarded with fees. They also function as the buyer of last resort. Should the collateral in the system not be enough to cover the amount of DAI in existence, MKR is created and sold on the open market to raise the additional collateral. \n\n MKR’s value is volatile and based on the concept that it is the only token that can be used to pay the fees for creating a CDP to generate DAI. As of 2018, there were approximately 530,000 MKR in circulation out of a total supply of 1 billion. Whenever they are used to pay fees, the MKR gets consumed and destroyed. The more MKR is ‘burned’, the more its value will increase while less of it is required to perform transactions. At launch, there was a total token supply of 1,000,000 MKR. \n\n The company was co-founded by Rune Christensen, who studied International Business from the Copenhagen Business School. He also a founder of Try China, an international recruiting company.

Ontology offers several distributed services including data exchange, data collaboration, digital identity authentication, blockchain creation, smart contracts, security protocols, and software development kits (SDK) among others.\n\nOntology was created in 2017 by the Shanghai-based company called OnChain, which is led by co-founders Erik Zhang, Jun Li, and Da HongFei.  Before creating Ontology, OnChain founded the NEO blockchain (formerly called Antshares) in 2014.  At the time of this writing, NEO is a top 20 cryptoasset ranked by market cap.\n\nOntology started off as a NEP-5 token on the NEO blockchain (which is comparable to an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain) but moved to its own blockchain in June of 2018.  Despite sharing the same parent company, Ontology and NEO are independent projects with different goals.  That said, the two projects have collaborated on building and promoting a NEO smart contract ecosystem.\n\nOntology employs a dual token system that consists of the ONT staking token and the ONG utility token.  ONT is used to stake and secure the blockchain while ONG is used to pay for token transactions, network storage, and the execution of smart contracts.  ONT tokens release ONG tokens which means ONT token holders will periodically receive ONG tokens.\n\nOntology’s consensus mechanism is called VBFT, which combines three different consensus protocols: proof-of-stake (PoS), Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT), and Verifiable Random Function (VRF).  Users who wish to stake ONT are required to set up a node on the Ontology platform.  In return for staking their ONT tokens, stakers receive a portion of network, storage, and smart contract execution fees.  ONT holders are able to vote on major upgrades and proposals for the Ontology network.\n\nInstead of an ICO, in March 2018, Ontology gave away ONT tokens to their email newsletter subscribers and airdropped ONT tokens to NEO token holders.  In the end, 20 million ONT tokens were distributed to the community.\n\nThe max supply of ONT is 1 billion.  Each ONT token is indivisible and all were mined in the genesis block.

The platform describes itself as a ‘smart asset blockchain’ which allows developers to build a number of decentralized applications (dApps) for fintech, logistics, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), and peer-to-peer payments. \n\n NEM stands for New Economy Movement, the premise of the platform is that it combines learnings from other cryptos (such as Bitcoin) with academic research in network theory. Its key advantage is its modular Smart Asset System, which enables businesses to replicate almost any business transaction on the blockchain with minimal development. Because NEM was created using Java, most programs can be easily adapted to utilize the network. It is sometimes described as a blockchain-based cloud platform. \n\n The founding vision of the protocol was to create a system that would give power to users, rather than coin hoarders and mining companies. One of the issues with the Proof of Work system used by Bitcoin (and many others) is that in order to mine tokens, you must use computational power; the greater your machine’s power, the greater the chance of earning coins. \n\n This has lead to a system where only those who can afford the latest and most expensive mining machines are able to profit, while the average person is not able to compete or contribute. Miners of larger amounts also have a tendency to hoard their coins without contributing to the system and if the amount they hold is large enough, they can gain control of the token network. \n\n To ensure a fairer system XEM cannot be mined or staked. Instead, the currency is harvested through the Proof of Importance (POI) algorithm and uses Delegated Harvesting to determine who can vest the next block. NEM’s POI system takes into account how much XEM a participant holds and whether they have actively helped the economy by transacting with others. Each user is given a trust score, the higher it is, the more chance they have of being rewarded. \n\n To begin vesting coins, a participant must place at least 10,000 unvested XEM coins in an approved XEM wallet. Over time, XEM coins pay out dividends (interest) and trust scores increase, as long as there is a balanced transaction history and the holder contributes to the community. \n\n There are 8,999,999,999 XEM in total, 75% of the coins were issued evenly to nearly 3,000 stakeholders after the launch of the genesis block on March 31, 2015. The remaining 25% of XEM was allocated to marketing and development expenses. The equal distribution is to ensure that no one can control the price or gain an advantage over others since each stakeholder only controls about 0.025% of the currency. \n\n The initial framework of NEM was laid out by an anonymous Bitcoin Talk forum user called UtopianFuture in 2014. By July 2018 the organization had grown to include the NEM Foundation and headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which serve as an incubator, accelerator, co-working space.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:16','2019-11-02 18:25:49',139068832.95,847613798.75,0.00,0.00,-0.002635,0.063130,-0.335595,0.046293,-2236.51686000),(1315,24854,31,'ZEC','Zcash',37.77077,1.00,0.007530,92629874.05000,1.00,293256271.42,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/zec.svg','1',1,'https://z.cash/','Equihash','PoW','21000000','Zcash (ZEC or ⓩ), also known as Zerocash, is a decentralized digital currency with privacy at its core. The asset comes in two forms: shielded and transparent. Although transaction data is posted to the blockchain like Bitcoin, a shielded protocol allows transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver, or transaction amount. The zero-knowledge proof constructions leveraged by Zcash are called zk-SNARKs (which stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge). \n\n Zcash includes selective disclosure features which allow users to reveal a degree of transaction information for compliance or audit purposes. It is also possible to execute completely transparent transactions to accommodate wallets and exchanges that do not support the privacy features. \n\n According to the website, the platform was built by top cryptographers based on the research of scientists from MIT, Technion, Johns Hopkins, Tel Aviv University, and UC Berkeley. It was founded by Zooko Wilcox (born Bryce Wilcox) who also founded the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, and created the Zerocoin protocol between 2013 and 2014. Zcash operates at the bleeding-edge of cryptography, requiring and producing novel research which is then freely shared with the rest of the ecosystem, including competitors. \n\n Released in October 2016, ZEC is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a fixed total supply of 21 million units and its mining reward is cut in half roughly every four years. Initially, 50 ZEC is created every ten minutes. Of the newly created ZEC 80% goes to the miners, and 20% to founders, employees, and investors - dubbed ‘the founder\'s reward’. It aims to discourage pump and dumps during the first few years of operation. For Zooko this represents an annual incentive of around $4.2M based on an exchange rate of $170/ZEC. \n\n After four years, the number of ZEC created every ten minutes will drop to 25, but 100% of it will go to the miners. The end result is that of the total ZEC, 10% (or 2.1 million) will have been distributed to the founders and early stakeholders. \n\n Developers have criticized the security of Zcash, in particular, the ‘ceremony’ which created the zk-SNARK public parameters; this involved six participants who created individual “shards” of the private/public key-pair and then burned them to DVDs. Participants followed a document called “Zcash Multi-party Computation Instructions” to create the shards. \n\n The document provided technical requirements for the hardware used, as well as instructions for downloading the required software and burning the shards to DVDs. The participants then allegedly destroyed their shards of the private key and combined the shards of the public key to create the zk-SNARK public parameters. It is said that all the computers involved were subsequently destroyed to prevent anyone gaining keystroke information. \n\n Technologists argue that there is no proof that participants did not conspire to keep the public key, or that cameras, radio signals or satellites could have been used to retrieve keystroke information.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:20','2019-11-02 18:25:49',700946823.17,3141209652.87,0.00,0.00,-0.004466,0.011873,-0.426451,0.054098,-4054.72876500),(1316,4432,33,'DOGE','Dogecoin',0.00259,1.00,0.002051,22536848.70000,1.00,315506183.97,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/doge.svg','1',1,'https://dogecoin.com/','Scrypt','PoW',' ','Dogecoin (DOGE) is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer cryptocurrency which was created in December 2013, as a tongue-in-cheek riposte to Bitcoin, and the crypto world generally. Its branding featured a likeness of a Shiba Inu dog from a ‘Doge’ meme that was popular at the time. By January 2014, it had quickly and unexpectedly generated a large community following and had reached a market capitalization of $60 million. \n\n The idea for Dogecoin was conceived by Jackson Palmer, a marketer at Adobe Systems in Sydney, who tweeted a joke concept combining two of the internet\'s most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. Billy Markus, a Portland, Oregon-based gaming geek and IBM software developer, made the concept a reality. According to Markus, it took him about three hours to create Dogecoin. \n\n Markus based Dogecoin on an existing cryptocurrency, Luckycoin, which features a randomized reward that is received for mining a block, although this was later changed to a static block reward in March 2014. In turn, Luckycoin is based on Litecoin, which also uses scrypt technology in its proof-of-work algorithm. He simply changed a few core elements, including replacing the word ‘mine’ with ‘dig’ (because that’s what dogs do). \n\n Markus went live with Dogecoin in his lunch break and within five minutes of launching no longer had enough computer power to dig the currency himself. Its coin supply of 100 billion was set to ensure that each DOGE would remain reasonably priced, and also because it was easier to dig them up. Markus split what he\'d mined 50-50 with Palmer. They each earned  $5,000 from the entire project. \n\n As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been dug up, while Bitcoin\'s final coin will be mined in 2140. An additional 5.256 billion DOGE are created every year and the supply is said to be infinite. \n\n One significant benefit of DOGE is that miners need only a minute to confirm a transaction, substantially less time than Bitcoin or Litecoin. Additionally, the Dogecoin system has no cap on the number of DOGE that users can dig up. As long as diggers continue operating, the DOGE supply will continue to expand. \n\n Dogecoin’s low transaction fees quickly made it a conduit for traders looking to convert their Bitcoin into cash without having to pay Bitcoin’s steep transaction fees. At several points in the last few years it was one of the top three actively traded cryptocurrencies, and in 2018 had a market cap of $2 billion, despite not having a software update since 2015. \n\n Dogecoin is known for its sustainable and friendly community, which offers assistance to members that are in trouble or have suffered hacks, and donates to interesting charitable causes. Some examples of charitable donations include earmarking $50,000 for the Jamaican bobsled team to go to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and a $30,000 contribution towards the construction of a well in the Tana River basin in Kenya. \n\n Dogecoin is commonly used for tipping. Users tip other users for posts or contributions on platforms that they believe deserve recognition. The tipping process is available on some popular social platforms through third-party apps. It’s similar to a Facebook ‘like’ but with more impact. \n\n Jackson, Dogecoin’s main spokesman, became disillusioned with the growing number of crypto scams and the emergence of institutional trading, which he believed was a step away from crypto’s original ethos. He left the company in 2015 without making a dime from his hobby project, handing over the development of Dogecoin over to trusted community members.

If a user wants to earn BAT, they can change their settings to make ads viewable.  Advertisers buy ads with BAT tokens, which are then dispersed to publishers (for hosting ads) and browser users (for viewing ads). \n\nBrave uses blockchain technology to anonymously monitor user attention so that users and publishers can be compensated accordingly with BAT.  Token holders will be able to use BAT for premium content or services on the BAT platform or tip them to publishers of their choice.  The ambitious goal of BAT is to rid the internet of the current online advertising system (along with the middlemen and trackers) and transform digital advertising so that users maintain their privacy, advertisers achieve higher ROI, and publishers receive more revenue.\n\nFor publishers who want access to their BAT tips, they must first be verified.  By signing up as a verified Brave publisher, content creators can obtain their tokens and even exchange them to a currency of their choice.

In addition, TrustToken is registered and regulated as a federal Money Service Business by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). \n\nUnlike BaseCoin and MakerDao which use algorithms to maintain price stability, TrueUSD keeps its value stable by being asset-backed.  New TUSD is minted when an escrow account receives US dollars.  When a token holder converts TUSD to USD, the commensurate amount of TrueUSD is immediately burned.  Both the creating and burning of TUSD occur automatically with smart contracts on the TrustToken platform.  In this way, the total supply of TrueUSD in circulation is always equal to the money in the escrow accounts.\n\nCohen & Company, a Maryland-based independent accounting firm, provides monthly audits of the collateralized funds held in the escrow accounts.  The results of Cohen & Company’s examinations are published in monthly reports available on the TrustToken blog.\n\nIn April 2019, TrustToken launched five new cryptocurrency stablecoins: TrueGBP which is backed by the British pound, TrueAUD which is backed by Australian dollars, TrueEUR which is backed by Euros, TrueCAD which is backed by Canadian dollars, and TrueHKD which is backed by Hong Kong dollars.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:37','2019-11-02 18:25:49',1938637785.64,7992255930.40,0.00,0.00,0.001211,0.000415,0.002841,0.000758,50.18074000),(1320,112392,40,'QTUM','Qtum',2.21169,1.00,0.035071,183839859.56000,1.00,212620452.89,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/qtum.svg','1',1,'','POS 3.0','PoS','107822406','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:41','2019-11-02 18:25:49',796595738.22,4069378504.66,0.00,0.00,0.223680,0.312502,-0.266293,0.313638,7807.44045000),(1321,347235,41,'BTG','Bitcoin Gold',8.28236,1.00,0.030473,15895728.63000,1.00,145056541.93,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/btg.svg','1',1,'','Equihash','PoW','21000000','Bitcoin Gold (BTG) is a cryptocurrency created from a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC).  Bitcoin Gold officially split from the original Bitcoin blockchain on October 24th, 2017. \n\nAccording to the website, the purpose of the Bitcoin Gold project is to restore the original decentralization of Bitcoin mining.  In the early days, Bitcoin (BTC) could be mined using regular computers.  That meant there were individual miners spread throughout the globe, each securing the platform.  However, as the network has grown, the only way to profitably mine BTC is to use ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).  ASICs are different from CPUs and GPUs in that they do only one thing, but they do it very well.  The use of ASICs has led to a monopolization of Bitcoin mining where a few big companies dominate.  If some of these large mining companies wanted to, they could join forces and issue a 51 percent attack where they control a majority of the network hash rate giving them the power to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from being confirmed.  \n\nJack Liao, CEO of the Hong King-based mining company Lightning ASIC, first announced the Bitcoin Gold project in July 2017.  Bitcoin Gold changes Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to create a digital asset that doesn’t require expensive, state-of-the-art hardware (ASICs) for mining.  Instead, Bitcoin Gold can be acquired using GPU (graphics processing unit) mining which makes it more accessible and theoretically, restores decentralization in the network. \n\nAs with any other hard fork, to claim Bitcoin Gold, users had to hold the original Bitcoin at the time of the fork to automatically receive an equal amount of Bitcoin Gold at the same address.  For people who held their BTC in hardware wallets, there were no issues.  However, for users who kept their BTC on exchanges, problems arose.\n\nAt the time, some of the largest crypto exchanges (including Coinbase and Kraken) announced they would not support BTG.  Coinbase wrote on their blog: “Information about this fork has been limited and there are concerns about its security and stability.  As a result, we do not believe it is safe to allow support for Bitcoin Gold at this time.”  At the time of this writing, Coinbase and Kraken still do not support BTG.\n\nAfter officially launching on November 1st, 2017, community members criticized the development team after they found that 100,000 BTG coins had been pre-mined.  The dev team responded by saying that the pre-mined funds would be used to support the growth of the Bitcoin Gold ecosystem.  In addition, about five percent were set aside as a bonus for the team.\n\nIn that same month, the official Bitcoin Gold website was compromised and promoted a link to a fake BTG wallet.  Users were encouraged to share their old private keys to claim their free BTG tokens.  Before it was discovered and removed, more than $3.3 million were stolen in this scam. \n\nIn May of 2018, Bitcoin Gold was hacked by attackers who deployed a combination of a 51 percent attack as well as a double-spend attack.  This was done to defraud crypto exchanges since they accept large deposits automatically.  The fraudsters made large Bitcoin Gold deposits on exchanges, and at the same time, sent the same funds to wallets they owned. When exchanges realized the transactions were fake, it was too late. The hackers already withdrew the large BTG deposits from the exchanges and multiplied their funds.  In the end, the hijackers stole more than $18 million in BTG from multiple exchanges, including Bittrex.\n\nHoping to prevent future 51 percent attacks, in June 2018, the Bitcoin Gold project changed their proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm from “Equihash” to “Equihash-BTG.”','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:44','2019-11-02 18:25:49',67586021.32,302530485.79,0.00,0.00,0.037917,0.094635,-0.529605,0.109776,-2758.23264000),(1322,348628,43,'KCS','KuCoin Shares',1.56861,1.00,0.033222,7538649.86000,1.00,136255252.25,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/kcs.jpg','1',1,'https://www.kucoin.com/#/','N/A','N/A',' ','KuCoin Shares (KCS) is the native token of the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange.  KuCoin Shares is built on the Ethereum blockchain and follow the ERC-20 token standard.  KCS token holders receive discounts on trading fees on the KuCoin exchange and also earn dividends. \n\nKuCoin is a Hong Kong-based centralized cryptocurrency exchange, founded in 2013 by Michael Gan and a team of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  Before KuCoin, Gan worked for Ant Financial (an affiliate company of the Alibaba Group), MikeCRM, and KF5.COM.  After four years of development and testing, the KuCoin exchange officially launched in August 2017.  \n\nIn September 2017, KuCoin completed their ICO for KuCoin Shares and following the sale, created 200 million tokens.  Participating investors received 50% of the total supply (100 million KCS).  Founders were allocated 35% of the total supply (70 million KCS) subject to a four-year lock-up period.  The last 15% of the total supply (30 million KCS) were given to early investors and consultants with a two-year lock-up period.\n\nKuCoin plans on buying back and destroying 50% (100 million) of the total token supply over time resulting in a long-term fixed supply of 100 million KuCoin Shares once the buyback is complete.  According to the white paper, 10% of the quarterly profits generated from the KuCoin exchange will be used to buy KCS from the market to be burned.  Buybacks are published to the KCS blockchain explorer, allowing users to audit and confirm that the program is running as it should be.\n\nAll KuCoin Shares token holders with at least 6 KCS receive a dividend call “KuCoin Bonus.”  At the end of each trading day, 50% of that day\'s trading fees are collected and used to buyback KCS from the market.  This KCS is then distributed to KCS token holders based on the size of their holdings.\n\nIn addition to the bonus, KCS holders receive a discounted trading fee, which (at the time of this writing) can be as low as 0.0125%.  If a token holder reaches certain levels, they can qualify for special services like one-on-one investment consultation, customer service Fast-Pass, etc.\n\nKuCoin plans on launching a decentralized exchange in the future that utilizes the KCS token.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:47','2019-11-02 18:25:49',78095575.40,535068076.22,0.00,0.00,0.204883,0.380930,-0.128897,0.456588,11739.28597000),(1323,187440,44,'OMG','OmiseGO',0.99803,1.00,0.040294,59501816.10000,1.00,139968943.43,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/omg.svg','1',1,'','N/A','PoS',' ','OmiseGO (OMG) aims to become a decentralized, universal payment processing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.  The OmiseGO platform is powered by the OMG token and will allow people, businesses, and organizations to send and receive payments in digital currencies as well as fiat.  In effect, OmiseGO hopes to replace legacy payment systems like SWIFT, ACH, and Western Union.  According to the website, the mission of OmiseGO is “to enable people to securely access financial services, invest, exchange and spend digital assets anytime, anywhere.”  \n\nThe OmiseGO project was founded in 2017.  The company behind OmiseGO is Omise, a payment gateway provider headquartered in Thailand.  The team is led by Jun Hasegawa (CEO).  Before Omise, Hasegawa was a Director at Alpha-do Inc and the co-founder and CEO of LIFEmee Inc.  Since 2013, Omise has been facilitating cross-border payments in six Southeast Asian countries.  Omise is also a payment processor for Alipay, which at the time of this writing is the world’s largest mobile payment platform in the world with over 1 billion users.  \n\nOmiseGO’s list of advisors includes some of the biggest names in the cryptosphere including Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum), Gavin Wood (also a co-founder of Ethereum), Roger Ver (Executive Chairman of Bitcoin.com) Julian Zawistowski (Director of the Golem Foundation), and Joseph Poon (co-creator of the Lightning Network).  \n\nOmiseGO is building a second layer blockchain on top of the Ethereum network using Plasma architecture.  Plasma is a layer 2 solution for Ethereum that provides a framework for building ‘off-chain’ decentralized apps that are fast, secure, and scalable.  The OmiseGO ecosystem will consist of a decentralized exchange, liquidity provider mechanism, clearinghouse messaging network, and asset-backed blockchain gateway.  With these features, developers can create dApps that offer services like payments, remittances, loyalty programs, and much more.\n\nOmiseGO was created to solve the fragmentation and centralization problems found in the payment processing industry.  Countries have different regulations and many payment processors are incompatible with their competitors which makes it difficult for ordinary people to send value across borders.  In addition, because these payment processors are centralized, they are vulnerable to hacks.\n\nThe ultimate vision of the OmiseGO platform is to launch its own mainnet and allow users to send, receive, and exchange all cryptoassets as well as fiat currencies.  OmiseGO is creating a white-label software development kit (SDK) that will allow businesses and organizations with a unit of value (e.g., reward points, fiat currency, cryptocurrency) to create their own branded wallets which will interact with the OmiseGO platform.  It is also creating a non-custodial decentralized exchange that will facilitate the swapping of the asset by bonding ETH to a smart contract.  For example, if Bob wants Alice to send him Yen but Alice only has US dollars, Alice can send Bob the US dollars using the OmiseGO platform and the decentralized exchange will automatically swap the USD to ETH, then the ETH will be swapped for Yen.  Now that it is in the currency that Bob initially requested, the money will be sent directly to Bob.\n\nThe settlement and clearing of transactions will occur on the OMG blockchain.  The underlying Ethereum blockchain will only be utilized to record the blockchain state.  This configuration allows the project to (theoretically) adopt cross-blockchain compatibility at the second layer.  According to the white paper, Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like systems will be allowed to trade on the OMG blockchain “via a clearinghouse network on the Lightning Network.”\n\nThe project uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.  Validators must stake OMG tokens in order to have a chance of verifying new blocks.  The validators earn fees from validating the activity of the blockchain.  If a validator behaves improperly, including deviating from consensus rules, their staked tokens will be burned on the OMG blockchain.  All OmiseGO validators must also run a full Ethereum node since staked OMG tokens are stored on the root chain.\n\nIn July 2017, the project canceled its public ICO because they reached their fundraising goal of $25 million during the pre-sale.  Following the pre-sale, a total of 140.2 million OMG tokens were created.  91.3 million (65.1% of total supply) were distributed to participating investors.  28.0 million tokens (20.0% of total supply) were allocated to OmiseGO for the continued development of the platform.  Team members received 13.9 million (9.9% of total supply) tokens.  The allocations to the project and the team members were subject to a one-year lockup period.\n\nIn September 2017, OmiseGO conducted an airdrop.  Anyone holding a minimum of 0.1 ETH could receive a portion of an OMG token for free.  A total of 7 million tokens (5% of total supply) were given away for this airdrop. \n\nIn April 2019, OmiseGO announced the public Alpha release of the OMG Network on the Ethereum test net.  The project claims they have been able to process millions of transactions with a peak throughput of over 2,700 transactions per second.  At the time of this writing, the Ethereum blockchain supports roughly 15 transactions per second.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:50','2019-11-02 18:25:49',192889550.94,884934763.18,0.00,0.00,0.156966,0.218113,-0.350588,0.285404,4578.59599500),(1324,930837,47,'EKT','EDUCare',0.12765,1.00,-0.016514,5201433.62000,1.00,108503919.09,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ekt.png','1',1,'https://ekt8.io/','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:09:52','2019-11-02 18:25:50',38119023.16,197942344.23,0.00,0.00,-0.093398,-0.196026,-0.005596,-0.110882,-5160.06901000),(1325,172091,50,'NANO','Nano',0.86569,1.00,0.025123,1336290.82000,1.00,115351637.61,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/nano.svg','1',1,'','Blake2b','PoW','133248297','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:03','2019-11-02 18:25:49',11836162.91,65682193.29,0.00,0.00,0.040045,0.177732,-0.252382,0.088297,1123.57942000),(1326,17778,52,'REP','Augur',9.54132,1.00,0.064971,8559647.08000,1.00,104954502.87,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/rep.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:10','2019-11-02 18:25:50',78995179.17,227270547.92,0.00,0.00,0.145596,0.135664,-0.133638,0.182176,4935.46612000),(1328,409492,54,'BCD','Bitcoin Diamond',0.52079,1.00,0.021251,3722670.27000,1.00,97123289.01,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bcd.svg','1',1,'','X13','PoW/PoS','210000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:18','2019-11-02 18:25:50',18337045.14,97408985.84,0.00,0.00,-0.031974,0.153770,-0.375808,0.152847,-721.25168000),(1329,19745,56,'LSK','Lisk',0.80022,1.00,-0.000490,688676.89000,1.00,97049954.22,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/lsk.svg','1',1,'','DPoS','DPoS',' ','Lisk (LSK) is a utility token used to pay fees associated with sending transactions on the Lisk blockchain.  The Lisk platform is a decentralized application solution written in JavaScript.  At the time of this writing, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language in the world.  By utilizing JavaScript, millions of developers have the opportunity to enter the blockchain space and build, publish, distribute, and monetize dApps on the Lisk platform.  According to the white paper, “Developers can quickly deploy their JavaScript apps to Lisk Hosting & Storage Nodes, gain listing in the Lisk Dapp Store, and have immediate access to Lisk Compute Nodes for execution of the code.”  Lisk aims to become the leading platform for decentralized application development in the world.\n\nLisk was founded by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows.  Before Lisk, Kordek and Beddows were actively involved in the development of the open-source blockchain application platform called Crypti (XCR) which was established in 2014.  After some disagreements with where the Crypti project was headed, Kordek and Beddows created Lisk from a hard fork of Crypti in May 2016.  The Lisk team is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland.\n\nUnlike Ethereum where dApps are executed on the mainchain, Lisk runs decentralized apps utilizing sidechain technology.  Sidechains are autonomous blockchains that are connected to the mainchain but don’t impact the performance or speed of the mainchain.  Sidechains give Lisk interoperability features.  For example, users will be able to transfer and swap tokens between the mainchain and sidechains.  Most importantly, sidechains allow developers to completely customize their decentralized applications.\n\nLisk offers a Sidechain Development Kit (SDK) which features an expanding collection of modules for programming a customized decentralized application.  The SDK includes four tools: Lisk Commander, Lisk Elements, Lisk Core, and the Lisk Hub. \n\nLisk allows token holders to register for usernames which are directly tied to a specific account.  Other users can send transactions to the username and the corresponding account will receive it.  Usernames eliminate the need to memorize long account addresses.\n\nLisk employs the delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism which was originally created by the BitShares (BTS) team.  With DPoS, new blocks are verified and created by 101 delegates.  LSK token holders can vote for up to 101 delegates.  The 101 delegates with the most votes are entrusted to validate new transactions on the blockchain.  Lisk rewards block generators with a fixed amount of tokens for each block successfully created and confirmed by the system.  If a delegate misbehaves or doesn’t properly generate a new block, token holders can remove their votes from that delegate and vote for someone else to replace them.  \nIn March 2016, Lisk announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring the blockchain application platform to the Microsoft Azure cloud.  In that same month, Lisk held a public token sale and raised over $5 million.\n\nOn May 24, 2016, the Lisk mainnet was launched.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:21','2019-11-02 18:25:50',8775035.96,57581941.85,0.00,0.00,0.040882,-0.071887,-0.386561,0.052238,-4149.72052000),(1330,20131,59,'WAVES','Waves',0.79631,1.00,0.014564,7444033.06000,1.00,79811444.92,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/waves.svg','1',1,'https://wavesplatform.com/','Leased POS','LPoS',' ','Waves is a blockchain platform that allows you to create your own custom token. According to its website, you can create your own token in less than a minute and use it for projects such as crowdfunding, loyalty reward programs, and in-app currencies. Tokens created on Waves have limited functionality compared to (for example) Ethereum, but are easier to create and require zero coding knowledge. \n\n The Waves coin (WAVES) is the platform’s native currency. You can use WAVES to create a trading pair with your self-made coin on the Waves decentralized exchange (DEX). There are two ways to acquire the currency, you can either install the Waves client on your computer and use its DEX to exchange fiat, Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or you can acquire WAVES through a third-party centralized crypto exchange. \n\n The platform has a Miner Reward Token (MRT) which is awarded to miners or platform members who support them; MRT can also be traded on the open market. To become a miner, a user must have a minimum effective balance of 10,000 WAVES in a personal account. WAVES holders can support the work of miners and earn income without by loaning their balance of tokens to the miners. The miners earn commission from processing the transactions within the platform. \n\n The project was launched in 2016 by Ukrainian entrepreneur Alexander (Sasha) Ivanov, a Theoretical Physics graduate of Moscow State University who pursued postgraduate studies at Leipzig University, Germany. In the same year it launched, Waves held a successful ICO, raising $2 million in less than 24 hours and a total of over $16 million. \n\n The total WAVES token supply is 100 million. One million tokens were distributed to early supporters, one million were put aside for post-ICO bounties, four million were reserved for strategic partners and backers, nine million were withheld by the development team, and 85 million were distributed in the ICO. \n\n The Waves platform itself has been described as a cryptocurrency version of the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform. According to the ICObench tracker, there were around 100 crowdsales on Waves in March 2018 spanning 25 categories. The top two fundraising successes included mobile gaming platform MobileGo, which raised $53 million, and cryptographic pension asset platform Peerbanks, which raised $42.6 million. As of 2018, the Waves platform was most popular among Russian and North American projects. \n\n In September 2018, Waves introduced smart contract functionality to the platform. The new features include multi-sig addresses, token freezing, atomic swaps, and voting. Waves’ smart contracts use a new programming language, RIDE, specifically made for the project. Waves’ smart contracts do not require Gas to execute like (for example) Ethereum.

According to the white paper, “The ICON Project aims to build a decentralized network that allows independent blockchains with different governances to transact with one another without intermediaries.” The goal is to build a platform where companies from various industries (e.g., healthcare, insurance, financial, educational, commerce) can interact and transact on a single network.\n\nICON was founded in 2017 by the Seoul based company, IconLoop (formally called theloop).  IconLoop is responsible for creating a private enterprise blockchain solution called loopchain.  The company has partnerships throughout the banking, healthcare, insurance, and financial industries.  IconLoop created ICON (a public blockchain) after hearing from its private enterprise customers that they wanted their private blockchains to have the ability to communicate with one another.  In other words, the companies utilizing loopchain (private blockchains) desired interoperability with other blockchains.  These companies saw the value in sharing data in a public network, thus the ICON network was born.  According to the white paper, anyone can create a new blockchain project and join the ICON network.\n\nIconLoop is owned by the DAYLI Financial Group (DFG), one of the largest fintech groups in South Korea.  DFG also owns Coinone (a popular cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea) as well as DaVinci (the largest AI provider in South Korea).\n\nICON uses a consensus algorithm called delegated proof of contribution (DPoC).  Similar to delegated proof of stake, (DPoS), ICON uses a proxy voting mechanism where token holders delegate their coins to P-Rep (public representative) candidates.  With enough votes, these public representatives will receive control of the network and produce as well as verify blocks on behalf of the users who delegated their coins to them.  The representatives can be changed at any time depending on their contribution level or governance status within the ICON Network.\n\nIn October 2017, ICON held an ICO where half (400,230,000) of the total supply (800,460,000) of ICX was sold to the public.  According to the website, the release schedule of the other 50% of total supply will be determined through annual C-Rep consultation.\n\nIn May of 2018, ICON announced a partnership with LINE, a global social media application company with over 200 million monthly users.

The 0x project utilizes off-chain transaction relayers and smart contracts to accomplish this.  Users of the protocol pay relayers with the native ZRX token.  In addition, the ZRX token is used for decentralized governance over the protocol’s upgrade system.  ZRX token holders have a voice in how the protocol should be improved over time depending on how many tokens they own.\n\nZRX is an ERC-20 token and as such can be stored in any Ethereum wallet.\n\n0x aims to solve the inefficiencies of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.  Although decentralized exchanges are great at security, they lag behind centralized exchanges in user operational costs (higher gas fees) and accessibility (slow). \n\nThe 0x protocol makes decentralized exchanges better by employing off-chain ordering relays together with on-chain settlements.  This allows users to broadcast an order off-chain that another user can fill.  It is only after a value transfer is executed that it is written on-chain, leaving all other trading commands to off-chain procedures.  Transactions are only run on the network when a trade is performed, allowing users to decrease their gas fees when trading.\n\nThe 0x Core Team, co-founded by Will Warren (CEO) and Amir Bandeali (CTO) in October 2016, leads the 0x protocol project.  Before 0x, Warren conducted applied physics research at the Los Alamos National Laboratory while Bandeali worked as a fixed income trader with DRW.  The 0x Core Team is headquartered in San Francisco with members distributed throughout the world.\n\nThe team created 0x OTC, a web app that allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly on the Ethereum blockchain using the 0x protocol.  In addition, they’ve created 0x.js, a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of building web apps on top of the 0x protocol. \n\nThe ICO was held on August 15th, 2017 and raised $24 million dollars.  There is a fixed supply of one billion ZRX of which 500 million (50%) were sold in the ICO.  The other 50% was released with 15% retained by the 0x team, 15% going to the developer fund, 10% going to the founding team, and 10% going to advisors and early backers.  The tokens set aside for founders, advisors, and team members are gradually released over the course of four years.  Tokens bought during the launch event were immediately liquid.\n\n0x is backed by the Fintech Blockchain Group, Pantera Capital, Polychain Capital, Jen Advisors, and Blockchain Capital.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:44','2019-11-02 18:25:49',50491450.19,289901280.49,0.00,0.00,-0.025135,0.410381,0.401299,-0.036531,8786.57029500),(1335,4430,67,'DGB','DigiByte',0.00687,1.00,0.029583,2137832.86000,1.00,85462864.17,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/dgb.svg','1',1,'','Multiple','PoW','21000000000','DigiByte (DGB) is a digital asset primarily focused on cybersecurity, IoT (Internet of Things) and decentralized currency.  Jared Tate, a programmer and entrepreneur, launched the DigiByte blockchain on January 10th, 2014.\n\nAlthough DigiByte is based on the Bitcoin protocol, a number of adjustments have been made in the code which make DigiByte unique.  For example, DigitByte allows for quicker confirmation speeds (15-second block time versus Bitcoin’s 10 minute block time).  In addition, DigiByte uses five secure and advanced cryptographic mining algorithms (SHA256, Scrypt, Odocrypt, Skein & Qubit) instead of one.  Using multiple mining algorithms prevents the centralization of mining compared to single algorithm blockchains. \n\nAnother difference is DigiByte’s implementation of DigiShield.  DigiShield was activated in February of 2014 and allows for the DigiByte blockchain to protect against multi-pools that mine large numbers of DigiByte at a low difficulty setting.  To achieve this, DigiShield recalculates block difficulty after each new block is mined.  This allows for a faster correction when a multi-pool mining operation begins or ceases contributing to DigiByte (rather than recalculating once every two weeks as is the case with Bitcoin).  Since first being implemented with DigiByte, DigiShield has been added into over 25 other cryptocurrency blockchains such as Dogecoin, Zcash, AuroraCoin, and others.\n\nDigiByte has never held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and is not controlled by a private company.  Committed to decentralization, the project is led by the DigiByte Foundation which is a decentralized volunteer-based community dedicated to supporting the DigiByte global blockchain through the three pillars of 1) education, 2) outreach, and 3) development.\n\nIn March of 2019, DigiAssets was announced.  DigiAssets is a scalable secondary layer secured on top of the DigiByte blockchain.  It allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity, and much more.\n\nThere are three layers to the DigiByte blockchain.  The first is the Applications layer and functions like an app store where decentralized apps (Dapps) and smart contracts can be built.  Digital assets can also be created on this layer using the DigiAssets protocol.  The second layer is called the Public Ledger layer which is what incentives the security of the DigiByte platform.  The third layer is the Global Network layer which provides communication and operating procedures for all the decentralized nodes (servers, computers, or mobile phones) connected to the DigiByte network.\n\nDigiByte is one of the first projects to implement SegWit (short for Segregated Witness) on their blockchain.  SegWit is a protocol upgrade that changes the way data is stored.\n\nAccording to the website, a total of 21 billion DigiByte will be created within 21 years (2014 - 2035).','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:50','2019-11-02 18:25:50',8465805.28,33564962.43,0.00,0.00,-0.241106,-0.001900,-0.361811,-0.133809,-8529.85316000),(1336,5039,68,'BTS','BitShares',0.02907,1.00,-0.006907,3313404.52000,1.00,79862941.81,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bts.svg','1',1,'','SHA-512','PoS','3600570502','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:54','2019-11-02 18:25:50',40222540.68,162593593.18,0.00,0.00,0.041193,0.050107,-0.353014,0.131907,-1374.05029000),(1337,714811,69,'THETA','Theta Token',0.09457,1.00,0.005263,2832291.04000,1.00,82324876.77,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/theta.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:56','2019-11-02 18:25:50',7859936.35,61150998.34,0.00,0.00,-0.005456,0.120264,-0.243185,0.143488,432.45834500),(1338,716522,73,'IOST','IOStoken',0.00684,1.00,-0.023535,38380404.96000,1.00,82182830.58,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/iost.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:10:59','2019-11-02 18:25:50',72783251.89,547646519.84,0.00,0.00,0.491622,0.326183,-0.309029,0.581632,13505.38175500),(1339,731516,74,'NPXS','Pundi X',0.00019,1.00,0.006386,1443079.32000,1.00,43346619.50,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/npxs.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','Pundi X (NPXS) is the native utility token that powers the Pundi X platform.  According to the website, “the mission of NPXS is to enable digital currencies to be more accessible to more people across the borders and further increase the utility of digital currencies.”  To accomplish this, Pundi X has built an ecosystem including hardware equipment and software products to help physical retail stores to buy, sell, and accept cryptocurrency. \n\nThe primary hardware product is the Pundi XPOS, a blockchain-enabled point of sale (PoS) device for merchants which can facilitate crypto payments and transactions through mobile wallets.  In addition to processing transactions, Pundi XPOS has its own app store where developers can create applications (such as wallets, insurance services, loyalty programs, retail intelligence, order management, and inventory management systems) for retailers to grow their businesses.  NPXS tokens are required to publish an app on the Pundi XPOS app store.  \n\nThe company plans on rolling out a minimum of 100,000 XPOS units to the global retail market by February 2021.  According to the company, the PoS device has already been shipped to over 30 countries including Australia, Colombia, France, Korea, Switzerland, South Africa, Taiwan, United States, and Uganda.  \n\nThe Pundi X team has also created XPass, a “smart card” where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies with a swipe.  With XPass, users can also make purchases at retailers that have the Pundi XPOS system.  The team plans on incentivizing participation in the Pundi X network by offering free XPOS systems to retail stores in select countries. \n\nThe project is backed by the Singapore-based company, Pundi X Labs.  The company was co-founded by Zach Cheah (CEO), Pitt Huang (CTO), and Danny Lim (CFO) in 2017.  Before Pundi X, Cheah spent 12 years in the browser and mobile gaming market, Huang started and sold several startups including a Groupon-like company at the age of 25, and Lim was a product designer with Baidu and Lenovo.\n\nIn January 2018, Pundi X held an ICO for their first token (PXS) and raised $35 million USD.  In the middle of 2018, the project transitioned to the NPXS token. Until September 2018, token holders could swap 1 PXS for 1,000 NPXS.\n\nNPXS is an ERC-20 token utilizing the Ethereum blockchain.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:04','2019-11-02 18:25:51',9108137.05,46924358.78,0.00,0.00,0.032231,-0.221769,-0.680845,0.028389,-9659.75957500),(1340,5280,75,'BCN','Bytecoin',0.00038,1.00,-0.022153,9511.13000,1.00,69820324.06,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bcn.svg','1',1,'','CryptoNight','PoW','184470000000','Bytecoin (BCN) is a privacy-centered cryptocurrency that launched in July 2012.  Based on the CryptoNote protocol which uses ring signatures and stealth addresses, the project claims that transactions are untraceable and unlinkable.\n\nBytecoin (BCN) should not be confused with Bytecoin (BTE), an inactive cryptoasset based off of Bitcoin’s (BTC) protocol.\n\nEach transaction on the Bytecoin network utilizes a one-time public key.  By doing this, the problem of address re-use is eliminated and decreases the traceability of transactions.  To help obscure the connection between users and transactions, ring signatures are used.  With ring signatures, transactions are digitally signed by one member of a group (each having their own private keys), however, there is no way for an outside observer to determine which one actually signed it. \n\nBytecoin uses an egalitarian proof-of-work consensus algorithm called “CryptoNight,” designed to restrict ASIC mining and make CPU and GPU mining equally efficient.  Each block time on the Bytecon blockchain is 2 minutes (compared to Bitcoin’s 10 minute block time).  To maintain a consistent block rate, the mining difficulty changes as the network hash rate increases and decreases after each block.  This protects the blockchain from “freezing up” even when the system traffic spikes or has a sharp drop in the number of miners. \n\nBytecoin is considered one of the first privacy coins to exist in the space.  Monero (XMR), a popular privacy project, is actually a fork from the original Bytecoin protocol.  \n\nSome have criticized Bytecoin’s mining history.  A prominent Monero developer argues that 82% of Bytecoins were pre-mined before the project was released to the public.  Bytecoin has a maximum total supply of 184.47 billion coins.  At the time of this writing, over 99% of the coins are already in circulation.\n\nThe founders of this privacy project are anonymous.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:08','2019-11-02 18:25:50',132398.72,756122.40,0.00,0.00,0.045477,-0.084520,-0.334526,0.016036,-4347.13939000),(1341,769546,76,'DAI','Dai',1.00570,1.00,-0.000983,2160082.69000,1.00,89394237.36,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/dai.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','Dai (DAI) is the first decentralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.  It is soft pegged to the US Dollar meaning the value of 1 Dai is roughly equivalent to $1 USD.  As an ERC20 token, anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer Dai.\n\nBecause the price of popular cryptoassets like Bitcoin and Ether are so volatile, few people are using them for everyday purchases.  That is why stablecoins were invented.  Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to other stable assets.  Unlike centralized stablecoins (for example Tether), the stability of Dai does not rely on a trusted third party.  Dai’s price is maintained using smart contracts and external financial incentives that keepers take advantage of.  A keeper is an independent actor (usually automated), who among other things, buys Dai when the market price is below the Target Price (i.e., $1 USD) and sells Dai when the market price is higher than the Target Price in order to gain a profit.\n\nDai is created when a user takes on a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP).  By depositing collateral (e.g., ether) in an Ethereum smart contract, a portion of the value of the locked assets are paid out in Dai.  Just like holding any other cryptocurrency, Dai can be used for various purposes: trading, payments, personal savings account, etc.  To reclaim the collateral from the CDP, the user must repay the borrowed Dai along with an extra stability fee. \n\nUsers can also purchase Dai directly from a broker or exchange.\n\nDai is part of the two-token system on the Maker platform.  Dai is the stablecoin targeting a value of $1 per unit, and Maker (MKR) is the utility token used to pay fees on Dai loans.  The Maker token also enables holders to contribute to platform governance by voting on proposals like increasing or decreasing the stability fee.  Where Dai is for everyday use, Maker - which is not a stablecoin - is specifically for people who want to help govern the Maker platform. \n\nThe MakerDAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), co-founded by Rune Christiensen in 2014, is made up of the Maker platform technical infrastructure and the community of Maker token holder (i.e., voters). \n\nAs of the time of this writing, MakerDAO has raised $27 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, FBG Capital, Walden Bridge Capital, Distributed Capital Partners, Wyre Capital, and more.\n\nMakerDAO is headquartered in Santa Cruz, California and also has offices in New York, Copenhagen, and Warsaw.\n\nMaker and Dai launched together on the Ethereum blockchain in December of 2017.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:13','2019-11-02 18:25:50',17836383.52,131516604.11,0.00,0.00,-0.002790,0.001993,0.009709,-0.001320,72.89690000),(1342,26132,77,'KMD','Komodo',0.56716,1.00,0.037201,941207.37000,1.00,66232677.86,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/kmd.svg','1',1,'','Equihash','dPoW/PoW','200000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:19','2019-11-02 18:25:50',11738758.10,55716753.98,0.00,0.00,0.076578,-0.034810,-0.425504,0.020941,-3664.20643500),(1343,218008,78,'BTM','Bytom',0.13037,1.00,0.140162,47291797.34000,1.00,130693303.73,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/btm.jpg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:22','2019-11-02 18:25:49',31480803.65,178341061.28,0.00,0.00,1.035590,1.330371,0.126869,1.379922,49229.20803000),(1344,13072,80,'SC','Siacoin',0.00210,1.00,0.008686,1388943.87000,1.00,87656552.39,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/sc.svg','1',1,'','Blake2b','PoW',' ','Siacoin (SC) is a utility token that powers the Sia Storage Platform, an open-source, decentralized cloud storage system.  The Sia platform allows users to earn Siacoin by renting out spare hard drive capacity or store files using other people’s spare hard drive space paying them in Siacoin.  The Sia blockchain is secured using a proof of work (PoW) consensus algorithm.  \n\nWhen a user uploads data to the Sia platform, it’s encrypted, divided into several smaller components, and stored on nodes all over the world.  The only way to access the data is to decrypt it with the user’s private keys.\n\nThe Sia network utilizes storage smart contracts where both the “host” (storage provider) and “renter” (user uploading data) lock up some Siacoin in a smart contract escrow along with a transaction fee that the renter pays.  After a specified time chosen by the renter, the system automatically checks to see if the data is still available from the host.  If the host is offline or loses the encrypted data, they forfeit their staked Siacoins in the escrow account.  If the host provides the encrypted data, their collateral is returned and they are paid via the smart contract.  \n\nThe Sia platform also has a secondary, revenue-sharing token called SiaFunds (SF).  This digital asset gives the holder a portion of the transaction fees each time a file is uploaded to the Sia network.  The purpose of SiaFunds is to incentivize token holders to improve the storage platform by bringing on more users.  With more people using the Sia network, SiaFund token holders receive more Siacoin. \n\nThere are only 10,000 SiaFunds and all have been pre-mined.  At the time of this writing, Nebulous Inc., Siacoin’s parent company, owned over 8,000 SaiFunds and the remaining were sold in a crowdfund to help finance early development.\n\nThe idea for Siacoin was conceived in September 2013 by David Vorick and Luke Champine at HackMIT, a student-run hackathon held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  At that time, both Vorick and Champine were undergraduate computer science students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.\n\nIn May 2014, they cofounded the Boston-based company, Nebulous Inc., the core development team behind the Siacoin project.  In that same month, Nebulous raised $240,000 from a SiaFund sale.  In September 2014, it received a seed round of $750,000 from investors including Procyon Venture and angel investor, Xiaolai Li.  \n\nLess than one year, the first public beta of the Siacoin network was released in March 2015.\n\nIn July 2019, Nebulous closed a $3.5 million pre–Series A round led by Bain Capital Ventures, along with participants like Bessemer Venture Partners and Dragonfly Capital Partners.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:26','2019-11-02 18:25:50',4054543.11,26282425.14,0.00,0.00,0.019275,0.293394,-0.220747,0.033571,1742.58962000),(1345,4433,82,'XVG','Verge',0.00383,1.00,0.019615,566004.42000,1.00,61458521.88,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/xvg.svg','1',1,'','Multiple','PoW','16555000000','Verge (XVG) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.  Originally created in 2014 as DogeCoinDark, it rebranded to Verge in 2016.  Verge utilizes multiple tools to enhance privacy including Tor (open-source anonymity software) and an anonymous network layer called I2P.  The project claims that locations, IP addresses, and transaction details are obfuscated. \n\nAt the time of writing, there are two wallets that can store Verge: the QT wallet and the Electrum wallet.  Electrum, an open-source Bitcoin lite wallet, was forked by the Verge team and updated so that it could work with the Verge blockchain.  The Verge Electrum wallet is focused on speed.  It uses a technology called, Simple Payment Verification (SPV), which verifies transactions on the Verge blockchain without downloading the whole blockchain.  According to the website, with SPV, average transaction confirmation times take approximately 5 seconds.  The QT wallet requires that users download the full Verge blockchain.  It has built-in TOR integration and SSL encryption which obscures user IP addresses.  \n\nIn January 2018, the project released the Wraith Protocol upgrade.  The Wraith Protocol is a technology that enables users to shift between public and private ledgers on the Verge blockchain.  This means that when transparency is required (e.g., charging customers for regular purchases), a public ledger can be used.  For situations that need anonymity (e.g., sending confidential financial support to an NGO operating in a hostile political environment), then a private ledger can be utilized.\n\nVerge uses five different proof-of-work (PoW) algorithms for mining - 1) Scrypt, 2) X17, 3) Lyra2rev2, 4) myr-groestl, and 5) blake2s.  Not only does this allow more people with different types of mining equipment to be able to mine Verge, but (theoretically) it should also provide greater security through decentralization.\n\nVerge was founded by Justin Erik Valo (a.k.a. Sunerok) who, at the time of this writing, continues as the project’s lead developer.  According to the website, “All contributors, including the Core Team, are unpaid volunteers who donate their time and energy into the project because they are passionate and believe in Verge.”\n\nIn November 2017, 125 million XVG were lost by a wallet app service (CoinPouch) that was recommended by the Verge core team.  While CoinPouch blamed Valo (Verge’s lead developer), Valo turned around and blamed CoinPouch for the incident.\n\nIn April 2018, Verge announced a partnership with Pornhub which, at the time of this writing, is in the top 40 for the most visited sites in the world.  Customers can use XVG to pay for all on-demand products and services.  According to Pornhub, a crypto payment method was one of the most requested features by its users. \n\nIn April 2018, the Verge network fell victim to a 51% attack.  In PoW based blockchains, if a miner (or mining pool) captures 51% or more of the network\'s mining power, they have the ability to double-spend (spend coins that were already spent).  Because the Verge blockchain switches between five different mining algorithms between each block, the attacker found a way to falsify the timestamps of the blocks and mined them with only one algorithm.  To exclude the blocks the attacker already minded, the Verge team implemented a hard fork quickly after the hack was discovered.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:28','2019-11-02 18:25:50',4441409.07,27608670.76,0.00,0.00,0.062628,0.192972,-0.354471,0.115214,687.84743500),(1346,5296,86,'MONA','MonaCoin',1.05044,1.00,-0.041400,577862.62000,1.00,69045072.55,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/mona.svg','1',1,'','Scrypt','PoW',' ','MonaCoin (MONA) is a cryptocurrency designed for peer-to-peer transactions via the MonaCoin network.

The digital asset is named after \"Monā\" or \"Mona,\" a cat-like figure created using ASCII characters that became a popular meme on the online community 2channel (2chan).  Although MonaCoin is popular within Japan, it’s struggled to find wider relevance in other countries. \n\nThe project was announced on 2chan by the alias, “Mr. Watanabe.”  Watanabe is one of the most common surnames in Japan.  Similarly to Satoshi Nakamoto (the creator of Bitcoin), the true identity of “Mr. Watanabe” is unknown.  \n\nMonaCoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mining algorithm is designed to be ASIC resistant.  It originally ran Scrypt (just like Litecoin) to fortify itself against ASIC mining but miners figured out a way to build Scrypt-compliant ASICs.  Committed to allowing regular GPUs and CPUs to mine the coin, MonaCoin was moved to the Lyra2REv2 hashing algorithm created by the team behind Vertcoin (VTC).  Monacoin also employs the Dark Gravity Wave v3 algorithm which readjusts its difficulty after each new block (90 second block time).  The total supply of MonaCoin is 105,120,000.  \n\nAlthough the creator of Monacoin is unknown, the project continues to be developed by its community.  MonaCoin was one of the first coins to implement Segwit and has also implemented the Lightning Network on top of the MonaCoin blockchain.\n\nThe MonaCoin Foundation was created in July 2014 by community members who wanted to promote the digital asset in Japan and throughout the world.  According to the website, the primary activities of the foundation are 1) to provide a place where MonaCoin owners can interact with one another and 2) the collection and dissemination of information related to MonaCoin.  Unlike other projects, none of MonaCoin’s developers are members of the foundation.  \n\nIn July 2014, the cryptocurrency was pushed into the national spotlight when Tokyo TV Network, WBS, reported that a man purchased a plot of land in Nagano, Japan with 32,001 MonaCoins and erected a Shinto shrine in honor of the digital asset. \n\nIn 2017, Akihabara (a region known as “the world’s largest electrical equipment marketplace” with thousands of merchants selling every technological device you can think of) began accepting MonaCoin as a form of payment.  More and more shops and restaurants in Japan have followed suit.\n\nIn May 2018, the MonaCoin blockchain was hacked with a selfish mining attack.  The attacker successfully established a longer chain and caused $90,000 in damages.  \n\nIn the fall of 2018, a hacker stole $134,500 worth of MonaCoin from Monappy, a social media network and web-based wallet.  In March 2019, the hacker was caught by the Tokyo police and was the first person in Japan to be charged with crypto theft.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:11:31','2019-11-02

','Bancor Network Token (BNT) is the hub token that serves as a link between all tokens, traded on the Bancor Network.  Thanks to BNT, all tokens, listed on the exchange, can be converted into each other.  The mechanics behind this is simple – BNT holds liquidity against ETH and every other token, traded on the Bancor Network.  That way, should one wants to convert ETH to LTC, for example, he can do that instantaneously thanks to BNT’s connector balance in both cryptocurrencies.  The way it works allows for flexibility and ease of conversion between all tokens.\n\nThe Bancor Network team describes the BNT as “the world\'s first Liquid Token.” BNT can be purchased by sending ETH to a particular address.  In return, the sender receives BNT tokens, according to their current price (which is estimated according to a methodology, developed by the Bancor Network team, and defined in the Bancor Protocol whitepaper).  BNT liquidation happens the same way around.  The amount of BNT in circulation is not static as BNT tokens are created each time when ETH is sent to their smart contract.  On the other hand, BNT tokens are destroyed every time a user sells his BNT back to the contract.\n\nBNT’s flexibility is thanks to the Bancor Protocol (the operational model of the Bancor Network), which allows for the standardization of a new type of natively liquid brand token.  The authors of the Bancor Protocol Whitepaper describe the Bancor Network Token as a “token for tokens.” The fundamental pillars of the Bancor Protocol are the so-called “Smart Tokens”.  The smart tokens are ERC20 compliant tokens that hold one or multiple connector balances in their smart contracts.  Thanks to that, smart tokens can be traded against any of the tokens on the network (if they are present in their connector balances).  What all smart tokens have in common though, is that they hold a shared connector balance in BNT.  This makes all of them tradable against each other.  The conversion between tokens happens instantaneously, without the need for matching buyers and sellers and at continuously calculated rates.\n\nThe idea behind the creation of the Bancor Network Token is to ease the use of the Bancor Network and link all tokens into one system that allows for instant and easy conversion.  The operational model of the Network supposes that if there is significant buying interest in a specific token (ETH, for example), it will result into an increased supply of BNT since the supply of its sub token (ETH in that case) has grown through new deposits of BNT into the connector balance.\n\nThe BNT’s Token Generation Event took place on June 12, 2017.  BNT then became the first smart token launched on the Bancor Network (a decentralized cross-chain liquidity network).  The BNT is managed by the Bprotocol Foundation, a nonprofit, headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, that aims to promote the Bancor Protocol as the leading global standard for Smart Tokens.\n\nThe Bancor project has four co-founders - Eyal Hertzog, Galia Benartzi, Guy Ben-Artzi, and Yudi Levi.  All of them are known for their vast experience in the tech field and venture capital industry.  The Bancor Foundation has also attracted industry experts from a variety of industries.  The board of the Foundation consists of 13 members among which can be distinguished the names of Tim Draper, founder of Draper University and Draper Associates, John Henry Clippinger, research scientist at MIT and strategic advisor to multiple organizations, Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation and co-founder of EOS Alliance, Yoni Assia, founder and CEO of eToro, Justin Rosenstein, co-founder of Asana and others.  The Network was lead by the well-respected international monetary policy expert Bernard Lietaer before his death on February 4, 2019.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:13:45','2019-11-02 18:25:57',9514374.07,59092338.54,0.00,0.00,-0.043650,-0.043264,-0.333249,-0.026985,-5103.80859000),(1387,887527,184,'TRUE','TrueChain',0.32840,1.00,0.057269,20540179.08000,1.00,26132507.44,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/true.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:13:48','2019-11-02 18:25:54',26949485.07,307304109.85,0.00,0.00,0.439037,0.399614,-0.204749,0.577218,15802.53796500),(1388,5020,186,'WDC','Wisdom Chain',0.16775,1.00,0.224912,388667.66000,1.00,20064184.32,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/WDC.jpg','1',1,'http://www.wisdchain.com/','Scrypt','PoW',' ','The Wisdom Chain is a brand new intelligent contract and communication platform, based on Block Chain, faced to smart city, achieving the Internet of Things for living facilities and interconnection for living information.\r\n\r\nIt aims to provide distributed data connection services for many intelligent items of human being, in order to share the data conveniently between personal terminal and the city intelligence terminal, and to share the Identity (ID) authentication, and can provide a consistent access ability of privilege data.\r\n\r\nAs a full set of solution to build an intelligent city information interconnection, it becomes a connector of a massive number of intelligent systems and devices.\r\n\r\nThe Wisdom Chain, as a bottom supporting system, will be released in the form of Main Chain, supporting parallel running structure of multi-chains and multi level communication protocol, including device interconnection protocol, terminal data sharing, ID authentication and instant communication protocol etc, achieving the network autonomy with the synchronization of node data through the mixture consensus mechanism by the combination of PoW (proof of work) and PoS (proof of stake), finally achieves the main chain faced to the living information interconnection.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:13:54','2019-11-02 18:25:57',3058145.66,14668644.01,0.00,0.00,0.220184,0.324149,-0.398311,0.425586,9967.83755500),(1390,757969,189,'BIX','Bibox Token',0.16308,1.00,0.039180,3109439.59000,1.00,17479574.53,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bix.png','1',1,'https://www.bibox.com/','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:14:00','2019-11-02 18:25:58',34343038.57,244177576.09,0.00,0.00,0.044343,0.127823,-0.414009,0.084715,-1163.44335000),(1391,179896,190,'PPT','Populous',0.53281,1.00,0.046342,1243645.00000,1.00,28373477.85,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ppt.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A','53252246','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:14:02','2019-11-02 18:25:53',8149608.94,18953341.76,0.00,0.00,-0.034919,0.188529,-0.269459,0.343051,3548.15249000),(1392,78152,193,'ANT','Aragon',0.71611,1.00,-0.019770,758.91000,1.00,21340373.07,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ant.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:14:06','2019-11-02 18:25:56',90482.86,224116.68,0.00,0.00,-0.095113,-0.027694,0.000000,-0.090551,-2880.47053000),(1393,905749,194,'SEELE','Seele',0.07028,1.00,0.035238,7623726.88000,1.00,48959007.03,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/seele.jpg','1',1,'http://seele.pro/','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:14:08','2019-11-02 18:25:51',19148151.40,41801775.88,0.00,0.00,0.199584,0.479647,1.670106,0.306266,31690.33570000),(1394,4630,196,'UNO','Unobtanium',68.98663,1.00,0.020976,129.88000,1.00,13880385.37,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/UNO.png','1',1,'http://unobtanium.uno/','SHA-256','PoW',' ','Unobtanium (UNO) is a rare SHA256d cryptocurrency which passed through its inflationary phase in 2013-2015.

(DCN) is a cryptocurrency developed specifically for use in the global dental industry.  As an ERC-20 token, Dentacoin utilizes the Ethereum blockchain.  By providing a set of incentivized software tools and a unique model of dental insurance (all of which use DCN), Dentacoin hopes to create a new ecosystem that shifts the focus of dentistry from “sick care” to “preventive care.”\n\nDentacoin was created by the Netherlands-based Dentacoin Foundation, which was co-founded in March 2017 by Professor Dimitar Dimitrakiev, Jeremias Grenzebach, and Philipp Grenzebach.  Before Dentacoin, Dimitrakiev was a university lecturer and spent over 27 years in the financial markets.  Jeremias was an early blockchain enthusiast and contributed code to Ethereum, Waves, ZCash, uPort, Status, imToken, and Byteball.  Philipp studied law, economics and business management.  Although the organization is called a “foundation,” the corporate entity is registered as a for-profit business.\n\nThe Dentacoin ecosystem consists of Dentacare, DentaVox, Trusted Reviews, and Assurance. Dentacare is a mobile app that teaches good oral hygiene through a 3-month challenge.  Users can earn DCN from using the app.  DentaVox is a market research platform that collects patient feedback through surveys.  Users are compensated with DCN after each questionnaire is submitted.  Trusted Reviews is a platform for verified dentist reviews.  According to the website, patient identities are verified through the blockchain and are rewarded with DCN for providing honest feedback.  Assurance is a dental insurance-like program where patients pay a low monthly premium in DCN to their dentists and in return receive lifelong, prevention-focused dental care.  DCN can be used to pay for dental treatment, dental care products, or exchanged for other currencies.\n\nThe Dentacoin Foundation believes its ecosystem will benefit dentists as well.  By joining the Dentacoin Network, dentists can earn more stable basic income via Assurance, create a more loyal customer base via Trusted Reviews, and improve customer satisfaction via DentaVox.  Dentists will be able to use DCN to buy dental supplies and dental equipment from participating merchants.\n\nIn June 2017, the Dentacoin Foundation bought Dentaprime, a London-based tooth implant clinic, for 31.5 billion DCN.\n\nAt the time of this writing, there are over 90 locations worldwide participating in the global Dentacoin Network and accept DCN payments.  Dentacoin partners can be found in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Hungary, Bulgaria, Serbia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Pakistan, Fiji, India, and the United Arab Emirates. \n\nThe max supply of DCN is 8 trillion tokens, all of which have been pre-mined and will be distributed via time-locked contracts as adoption grows.\n\nThe ICO for Dentacoin occurred on October 2017, where 3% of the total supply went on public sale.  They raised approximately $2.6 million.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:17:10','2019-11-02 18:25:58',712614.48,4677566.66,0.00,0.00,-0.124805,-0.211441,-0.297000,-0.286294,-11391.83561500),(1447,178467,324,'WGR','Wagerr',0.08440,1.00,0.041273,38817.90000,1.00,15928755.01,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/WGR.png','1',1,'https://www.wagerr.com/','PoS','N/A',' ','Wagerr uses distributed blockchain technology to execute betting contracts.

Request Network, (REQ) is a decentralized platform for transaction requests.  Anyone will be able to create, store, and access invoices and receipts using the Request protocol.  To participate in the Request network, users must use the REQ ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain.  REQ tokens can also be used to create advanced requests on the network as well as reward parties who help build the Request ecosystem.  According to the white paper, the ambitious goals of the project are to automate real-time global accounting, eliminate manual tax collection, simplify international payments, allow machines to communicate using the same decentralized ledger, and replace payment systems such as Paypal.  The project claims to be cheaper, faster, and more secure than centralized payment processors.\n\nChristopher Lassuyt and Etienne Tatur founded Request in 2017 after leaving Moneytis, a global money transfer platform that they co-founded in 2015.  While working on Moneytis, Lassuyt and Tatur found that invoices were the majority of cross country money transfers.  They believed that blockchain technology could simplify the process so they pivoted and created Request.  The company is registered in Singapore but is headquartered in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe Request protocol consists of 3 layers.  The core layer holds the basic smart contracts used to create and detect payment requests.  The extensions layer is an open layer that allows for various payment conditions (e.g., payment terms, advances, escrows, and taxes).  Finally, the application layer is the outermost layer which takes place outside the blockchain.  Here, the various systems from different financial organizations can connect to the Request network to obtain invoices and facilitate payments.\n\nThe protocol works as follows: a payee makes a payment request via the network.  The payer, upon accepting the request, pays the payee through the same network.  Both the request and payment are registered as a single ledger entry on the blockchain.  While all data is saved on a public blockchain, it is secured using elliptic-curve encryption so that it can only be read by the parties involved in the transaction.  Because payment information is never shared between the two parties, sensitive financial information is not at risk of being stolen.\n\nRequest uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm to secure its blockchain.  The REQ token will act as an intermediary for cross-currency exchanges and will also be used to form governance for the decentralized platform.\n\nThe project completed their ICO on October 2017 and raised $33 million.  50 percent of the total supply were given to participating investors.  Early backers and contributors received 20 percent.  Request retained 15 percent of the total supply which will be used for further protocol development.  The last 15 percent was allocated to the team and advisors with a 2-year lock-up period.\n\nIn March 2018, the Request Protocol officially launched on the Ethereum mainnet.  In addition, the team also released a JavaScript library so that developers could expand coin support to include Bitcoin and all other ERC-20 tokens.\n\nIn June 2019, Request released the Request API which will allow developers to use the core Request protocol functionality without learning any new development skills.  This lowers the entry point for developers to connect their product or service to the Request network.\n\nIn August 2019, the project launched version 2 of the Request Protocol on the Ethereum mainnet.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:18:26','2019-11-02 18:25:59',844802.94,5795283.71,0.00,0.00,0.037566,0.297119,-0.062698,0.100684,4698.88820000),(1468,185695,386,'PRO','Propy',0.10939,1.00,-0.003609,116677.96000,1.00,5242402.78,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/pro.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:18:32','2019-11-02 18:26:13',236813.51,9770096.48,0.00,0.00,0.022503,-0.119954,-0.439826,-0.016750,-6467.03329000),(1470,177157,389,'ACT','Achain',0.01006,1.00,0.036194,1100219.27000,1.00,9592761.87,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/act.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A','1000000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:18:43','2019-11-02 18:26:00',3147057.18,16989499.51,0.00,0.00,0.141242,0.119550,0.000000,0.167717,5712.83303000),(1471,5305,392,'BLOCK','Blocknet',0.95656,1.00,-0.065338,59840.90000,1.00,5956064.86,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/block.svg','1',1,'','PoS','PoW/PoS',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:18:46','2019-11-02 18:26:09',63355.59,318386.53,0.00,0.00,-0.202736,-0.032457,-0.468406,-0.113222,-10477.01329000),(1472,222085,393,'NEBL','Neblio',0.48702,1.00,0.018324,74966.49000,1.00,7326430.69,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/nebl.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:18:49','2019-11-02 18:26:01',1248739.50,7199505.14,0.00,0.00,0.018254,0.179496,-0.393231,0.170881,206.70422000),(1473,4571,396,'NAV','NAV Coin',0.09701,1.00,0.023702,132830.98000,1.00,6458218.43,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/nav.svg','1',1,'','X13','PoW/PoS',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:18:55','2019-11-02 18:26:08',1095999.62,5890665.79,0.00,0.00,0.151553,-0.028623,-0.221642,0.184838,1585.10100000),(1474,184298,397,'PLR','Pillar',0.04139,1.00,0.398049,14089.47000,1.00,10733667.26,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/plr.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A','800000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:18:58','2019-11-02 18:26:00',56879.74,200276.50,0.00,0.00,0.460328,0.954978,0.039877,0.495991,28449.86903000),(1475,714255,399,'OCN','Odyssey',0.00091,1.00,0.113077,595464.23000,1.00,6077739.45,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ocn.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:05','2019-11-02 18:26:09',3318261.06,15894227.17,0.00,0.00,0.169402,-0.084682,-0.489129,0.214781,-538.51358000),(1476,586088,400,'DBC','DeepBrain Wallet',0.00175,1.00,0.007104,172622.98000,1.00,5588524.44,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/dbc.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A','10000000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:08','2019-11-02 18:26:12',1224439.15,6250628.37,0.00,0.00,-0.043220,0.120557,-0.325710,0.027218,-2417.32814000),(1477,397757,408,'QSP','Quantstamp',0.01163,1.00,-0.001570,140997.78000,1.00,7181809.69,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/qsp.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:12','2019-11-02 18:26:01',1194563.17,11627787.77,0.00,0.00,0.044050,0.056107,-0.163024,0.078926,317.64804000),(1478,307219,410,'RCN','Ripio Credit Network',0.04397,1.00,0.051521,597396.37000,1.00,22393414.61,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/rcn.svg','1',1,'','N/A','PoW',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:15','2019-11-02 18:25:56',1408131.85,7312965.33,0.00,0.00,0.083119,0.092570,1.478838,0.203596,22293.89650000),(1479,752710,411,'BLZ','Bluzelle',0.02614,1.00,0.022673,108185.14000,1.00,5512241.63,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/blz.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:19','2019-11-02 18:26:13',1198185.32,6952969.45,0.00,0.00,0.034110,0.003097,-0.294383,0.011612,-2515.97318500),(1480,166594,416,'NMR','Numeraire',5.32583,1.00,-0.043676,135165.53000,1.00,7186286.01,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/nmr.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A','11000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:23','2019-11-02 18:26:01',12072.58,192878.20,0.00,0.00,0.283251,0.084161,-0.211180,0.221427,4387.55927500),(1481,792548,419,'NCASH','Nucleus Vision',0.00096,1.00,0.033199,137263.36000,1.00,5765310.24,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ncash.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','nCash (NCASH) is a non-mineable utility token that enables data exchange in the Nucleus Vision ecosystem.  The goal of Nucleus is to provide brick and mortar stores the ability to give their offline customers an online customer experience.  Utilizing blockchain and IoT technologies, physical businesses will be able to offer personalized pricing, tailored recommendations, and real-time offers to their customers as they are walking throughout the store.  In addition, customers can also earn nCash tokens each time they visit a store that uses the Nucleus Vision platform.\n\nCustomer data is abundant online which gives eCommerce stores the ability to offer personalized experiences for customers.  For example, if a first-time visitor lands on an eCommerce site, a pop-up can give that person a 10% discount on their first purchase.  If a loyal customer returns to the site, the page can thank the customer by name and recommend new products/services based on their specific purchase history.  \n\nLaunched in 2014, Nucleus Vision aims to bridge the divide between the online and offline retail customer experience.  The foundation of the ecosystem is its patent-pending sensor technology called ION.  Instead of depending on RFID, WiFi, Bluetooth, or even facial recognition technologies, the ION sensor detects customers’ smartphones via radio frequencies when they are within a certain range.  Upon entering a store, the ION sensors will register the customer’s phone and will ask them if they’d be willing to share their information with the store.  If the customer consents, the ION sensors push the data (via Nucleus Vision’s blockchain called “Orbit”) to the Neuron neural network.  The network’s deep-learning algorithms analyze customer data and provide the merchant with real-time customer information (e.g., upcoming life events, purchase history, age, gender, etc.).  \n\nMerchants are required to use nCash tokens to move data throughout the Nucleus Vision network.  In addition, merchants must pay nCash to data providers who give insights about their customers.  To protect user privacy, customers will be able to opt-out of the service at any time.  When users consent to share their information, they will receive nCash tokens which can be used to pay for products and services within the store.\n\nnCash is an ERC-20 token that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nAt the time of this writing, Nucleus Vision claims that they have prototypes running in 10 retail stores in India and that they have signed deals with brands to install their technology in 14,000 more locations in the next few years.\n\n\n\nNucleus Vision was founded by Abhishek Pitti in August 2014.  Prior to Nucleus, Pitti worked as an aerospace engineer.  \n\nThe ICO was scheduled for January 2018 but was canceled because, during the pre-sale, they were able to raise the full amount of the hard cap ($40 million).  The total token supply is 10 billion NCASH.  All tokens will be distributed as follows: 40% goes to public participants, 25% is reserved for the company, 25% goes to the development team and employees, 5% goes to advisors, and the last 5% goes to the bounty program.\n\nThe project has been backed by Tim Draper, IndusAge Partners, among other investors.\n\nAt the time this is being published, Nucleus Vision is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:27','2019-11-02 18:26:10',2412338.93,16057907.78,0.00,0.00,0.031083,0.028921,-0.371242,0.084879,-2090.92239000),(1482,5282,427,'XDN','DigitalNote',0.00060,1.00,-0.022574,1984.36000,1.00,4416671.79,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/xdn.svg','1',1,'','CryptoNight','PoW','10000000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:32','2019-11-02 18:26:17',68008.87,194220.15,0.00,0.00,0.103237,0.212418,-0.434830,0.120062,80.12076500),(1483,5325,428,'FLO','FlorinCoin',0.02987,1.00,-0.016189,19545.83000,1.00,4550087.65,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/flo.svg','1',1,'','Scrypt','PoW','160000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:36','2019-11-02 18:26:16',111846.15,441702.95,0.00,0.00,-0.248720,-0.357129,-0.333352,-0.235543,-14358.57351000),(1484,218107,430,'XAS','Asch',0.08498,1.00,-0.086418,726356.64000,1.00,7933575.75,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/xas.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:39','2019-11-02 18:26:01',2089504.18,8876005.38,0.00,0.00,0.722963,0.622187,0.132497,0.827862,27381.47082500),(1485,23728,431,'SBD','Steem Backed Dollars',0.71733,1.00,0.021087,33803.62000,1.00,5328725.36,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/steem.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:42','2019-11-02 18:26:13',167105.61,1334365.21,0.00,0.00,0.078047,0.097636,-0.244036,0.021193,-151.77942500),(1486,713186,433,'DTA','Data',0.00045,1.00,-0.014221,251370.73000,1.00,4371233.37,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/dta.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A','11500000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:46','2019-11-02 18:26:17',871786.35,4983059.01,0.00,0.00,0.302584,0.209439,-0.529274,0.319251,4036.00744500),(1487,4337,434,'BET','DAO.Casino',0.03525,1.00,0.081686,425.67000,1.00,5896279.00,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bet.svg','1',1,'','SHA-256','PoW',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:49','2019-11-02 18:26:09',17008.30,86870.18,0.00,0.00,0.000000,0.301096,0.634968,0.378469,16585.52710000),(1489,400702,439,'JNT','Jibrel Network Token',0.02760,1.00,-0.007109,2495.13000,1.00,4694992.87,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/jnt.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:19:58','2019-11-02 18:26:16',72932.93,438261.44,0.00,0.00,0.147629,0.188388,-0.022851,0.167485,5855.05114000),(1490,170452,440,'ADX','AdEx',0.08317,1.00,-0.015399,486976.64000,1.00,6659375.35,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ADX.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A','100000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:20:05','2019-11-02 18:26:08',3427187.25,11988790.53,0.00,0.00,0.139434,0.240961,0.000000,0.176605,6664.93882500),(1491,524113,442,'SMT','SmartMesh',0.00447,1.00,0.015181,72032.25000,1.00,5991023.34,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/smt.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:20:09','2019-11-02 18:26:09',285861.97,3033701.63,0.00,0.00,0.244550,0.291503,-0.309246,0.341548,7442.51052500),(1492,208914,445,'MTH','Monetha',0.01443,1.00,0.023953,137102.01000,1.00,5805977.74,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/mth.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:20:13','2019-11-02 18:26:10',7797373.72,63871375.71,0.00,0.00,-0.025955,-0.076288,0.026200,0.023057,-374.92236000),(1494,196541,450,'LINDA','Linda',0.00020,1.00,0.150996,72.70000,1.00,2703368.83,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/LINDA.png','1',1,'http://lindacoin.com/','Scrypt','PoW/PoS','30000000000','WHAT IS LINDACOIN:\r\nLindacoin is a proof of stake digital currency.

XTRABYTES is a completely decentralized, secure platform that has real world use, as it is scalable, with a transaction volume capacity that is head and shoulders above other crypto platforms.\r\n\r\nThe XTRABYTES platform is designed to be built upon through D-Apps that can be written in nearly any programming language. From the X-CHANGE, a decentralized cryptocurrency trading platform (DEX), to the X-VAULT, a secure, encrypted data storage, XTRABYTES offers it all. Since most people in the cryptocurrency space have not heard of XTRABYTES yet, this project is highly undervalued. With its grand vision, XTRABYTES is focused on solving all of the most pressing issues in the cryptocurrency world.\r\n\r\nSince the XTRABYTES project is still in its infancy, it is highly undervalued at the moment. With the potential to unseat the top cryptocurrencies on the market due to its innovative tech, XTRABYTES is the most exciting project in the industry right now.\r\n\r\nXtraBytes (XBY) is different because the XBY isn’t presented as another security coin, rather, it is a fully-fledged platform that can be applied in unlimited fields. The platform will also make it possible for users to integrate any known coding language, in the process eliminating the limitations that other projects face. The fact that XtraBytes (XBY) transactions can be confirmed instantly using a technology that can complete up to 10,000 transactions per second is another selling point. Its transaction speed is far beyond what Ripple (1500 tps) has to offer. In addition to that, the developers of the platform also claim that their system can repel up to 51% attack preventing any forks in the future.','0','0','2019-09-12 23:20:46','2019-11-02 18:24:51',8300.07,19141.00,0.00,0.00,0.000000,-0.091037,-0.644028,-0.000498,-8504.99907000),(1502,192400,464,'DMT','DMarket',0.09445,1.00,-0.042976,944995.08000,1.00,5376067.69,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/dmt.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:20:49','2019-11-02 18:26:13',920547.50,4833769.13,0.00,0.00,0.164995,0.657757,-0.278538,0.544654,13066.28963500),(1503,199901,473,'SMART','SmartCash',0.00299,1.00,0.003794,131937.77000,1.00,4220657.30,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/smart.svg','1',1,'https://smartcash.cc/','Keccak','PoW','5000000000','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:20:52','2019-11-02 18:26:17',547023.04,2387810.89,0.00,0.00,-0.078608,0.131894,-0.410040,0.072703,-3162.91193000),(1504,380641,475,'SRN','SIRIN LABS Token',0.00908,1.00,0.009716,146292.28000,1.00,4465349.71,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/srn.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:20:58','2019-11-02 18:26:16',1350732.62,5969058.79,0.00,0.00,0.131718,0.062165,-0.316838,0.068962,-277.41754500),(1505,718353,476,'SWFTC','SwftCoin',0.00122,1.00,0.020970,1600801.76000,1.00,4428592.36,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/swftc.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:21:02','2019-11-02 18:26:17',12099076.95,61387392.96,0.00,0.00,0.074219,0.089173,-0.271467,0.173488,1285.70378500),(1506,255777,477,'PST','Primas',0.05029,1.00,0.005791,40854.77000,1.00,2649854.62,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/pst.png','1',1,'','Scrypt','PoW',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:21:08','2019-11-02 18:24:51',12399692.97,41850468.66,0.00,0.00,-0.207983,-0.425662,-0.552589,-0.264660,-17304.14940500),(1507,385952,481,'GVT','Genesis Vision',1.10207,1.00,-0.014200,573035.87000,1.00,4878750.16,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/gvt.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-12 23:21:11','2019-11-02 18:26:15',2197347.62,11884915.27,0.00,0.00,-0.026485,-0.037704,-0.378757,0.071692,-4406.36932000),(1509,42598,490,'XSPEC','Spectrecoin',0.10038,1.00,-0.039448,4681.17000,1.00,2253181.07,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/XSPEC.png','1',1,'https://spectreproject.io/','POS 3.0','PoS',' ','SpectreCoin (XSPEC) is an innovative privacy-focused cryptocurrency, featuring an energy-efficient proof-of-stake algorithm that provides rapid transaction confirmations, ring signatures for privacy and anonymity, and a fully integrated Tor+OBFS4 layer for IP obfuscation within the wallet.\r\n\r\nSpectrecoin is actively developed, with an ambitious roadmap that prioritises privacy, security, and true decentralisation with features such as default stealth addresses and stealth staking, and low-power mobile wallet staking in our upcoming Android wallet.\r\n\r\nSpectrecoin can be exchanged on several exchanges. The goal of Spectrecoin is to combine a blockchain with a tokenized ring-signature scheme to build a system of anonymous digital cash. The ring-signature scheme used here was first introduced by Shadowcat, and is now being improved on by the Spectrecoin developers. For network-level privacy, all nodes communicate exclusively within the Tor network via hidden services. The priorities of the Spectrecoin project are on privacy, technical soundness and simplicity. The Proof-of-Stake consensus method is used to provide environmental friendliness, decentralization and transaction speed.

After the year 2016, stakers will receive a fixed 5% indefinitely as reward for securing the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoS variable interests:\r\n- 1st year: 20%\r\n- 2nd year: 15%\r\n- 3rd year: 10%\r\n- 4th and subsequent years: 5%\r\n\r\nMintCoin is often compared with its close counterpart - Peercoin and NXT.','0','0','2019-09-13 00:23:52','2019-11-02 18:24:53',274.91,6244.05,0.00,0.00,0.000000,0.017535,-0.410769,-0.148889,-6374.54279000),(1617,411496,672,'SPANK','SpankChain',0.00726,1.00,-0.130274,271.89000,1.00,2177390.70,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/spank.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-13 00:27:19','2019-11-02 18:24:53',8175.53,17929.62,0.00,0.00,0.039429,0.243560,-0.050141,0.164297,3394.51945500),(1621,719272,673,'YEE','YEE',0.00150,1.00,-0.039026,155652.92000,1.00,2044630.56,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/yee.png','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-13 00:30:42','2019-11-02 18:24:53',906144.94,5044507.28,0.00,0.00,0.039269,0.390030,-0.276493,0.439001,7030.27677000),(1625,67447,674,'LUN','Lunyr',1.09837,1.00,-0.017693,163230.27000,1.00,2523890.53,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/lun.svg','1',1,'','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-09-13 00:34:07','2019-11-02 18:24:51',1671009.66,5545899.28,0.00,0.00,0.183162,0.074538,-0.057493,0.287923,5918.37464500),(1626,9999,18,'IOT','IOTA',0.27490,1.00,0.007922,2549269.00000,1.00,764094437.98,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/iot.svg','1',1,'https://www.iota.org/','Not Available','Not Available','2779530283','IOTA (IOT) is the native currency of the IOTA platform designed to maintain, facilitate, and create an incentive for a machine-to-machine economy. It does this by providing an information and transfer system with a protocol that allows near instantaneous, scalable, and secure transactions. The coin is sometimes listed and referred to as MIOTA, which refers to a million IOTA. \n\n The most striking difference about the IOTA platform, compared to others, is that it uses a new distributed ledger technology and quantum-proof protocol, called the Tangle. Instead of the traditional blockchain, Tangle technology uses a method known in mathematics as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Whereas blockchain is a sequential chain of blocks in which each block references its chronological predecessor, similar to a linked list, with DAG technology each transaction (rather than a block of transactions) references two previous transactions, forming not a linked list, but a complex web structure. \n\n Tangle aims to overcome the inefficiencies of current blockchain designs by introducing a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system. IOTA\'s transactions are free regardless of the size of the transaction, it claims confirmation times are faster, the number of transactions the system can handle simultaneously is unlimited, and the system can easily scale. IOTA promises that the more people that use the network the more efficient it becomes. This compares favorably to blockchain which is often slower or unusable with increased traffic. \n\n The platform is developed to support the future Internet of Things (IoT), for example, networks of devices such as vehicles, or home appliances that contain electronics and software that interact and exchange data. \n\n The IOTA coin cannot be mined: the entire volume of coins was released immediately at the time of creation. If you are working in IOTA, you do not create new IOTA tokens, but simply confirm other transactions. The total token supply of IOTA is 2,779,530,283,277,761. This value is optimized for ternary computation and is the largest possible 33-digit ternary number. \n\n Longevity of the coin is said to be bolstered by the platforms early high profile strategic partnerships with big brands including Volkswagen, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, and Bosche. Because the IOTA platform has the potential to manage vast automated systems, it has the potential to become the source code for IOT, or even the ‘Internet of Everything’ as contracts and transactions get faster. \n\n IOTA was founded in 2015 by a group of entrepreneurs, mathematicians, and developers including David Sonstebo, Sergey Ivancheglo, Dominik Schiener, and Dr. Serguei Popov. In November 2017, the team created the  IOTA Foundation which became the first regulated, non-profit in Germany funded exclusively by cryptocurrencies. It oversees IOTA and is dedicated to developing the technology and maintaining it license-free for all developers to work with. \n\n In order to send an IOTA transaction, a user must validate two transactions via a device such as a laptop or a phone. The device performs low difficulty ‘proof of work’, which is essentially just a series of math problems that require a solution. This removes the need for miners and validators, the key benefit is that it prevents centralized mining companies gaining control of the network. In 2018, for example, it was said that just 8 mining pools were responsible for 75% of the Bitcoin mined.','0','0','2019-09-13 14:48:25','2019-11-02

SV is short for Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) and is a cryptocurrency that claims to be closer to the original Bitcoin template as envisioned by its creator. The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. \n\n The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network. \n\n Bitcoin was first released as version 0.1 in January 2009, by Satoshi and was published on SourceForge, an online collaboration platform for developers. In 2017, the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created which increased the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed. \n\n In November 2018, there was a difference in opinion between the Bitcoin Cash community over stability, scalability, security, and safety issues. This caused a so-called ‘hash war’ as two developer camps fought for control of the Bitcoin fork, which ended in a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash. The result was the creation of Bitcoin SV which is intended to provide a clear Bitcoin implementation choice for miners and allow businesses to build applications and websites on it reliably. \n\n Leading the charge for the fork was Australian Craig Wright, ‘the self-proclaimed inventor of Bitcoin’. He is a co-founder of the BCOMM Association which aims to safeguard Bitcoin from unnecessary diversion from its original protocol. At the time of the fork, he was also Chief Scientist at nChain, a blockchain technology research and development company which later initiated the development work on Bitcoin SV. \n\n Bitcoin Cash follows the Bitcoin Cash ABC protocol and roadmap published by bitcoincash.org. Bitcoin SV follows the Bitcoin Cash SV protocol and roadmap published by nChain. According to the Bitcoin SV website, the fork was created at the request of leading BCH mining enterprise CoinGeek. The Antiguan-based mining division is owned by Calvin Ayre, the billionaire online gambling tycoon. \n\n The chief aim of Bitcoin SV is to propagate large blocks. This feature is said to require a certain centralization of miners and node operators. In December 2018, Bitcoin SV had seen up to 512 nodes (a program that fully validates transactions and blocks), with four chief miners controlling 74% of the hash rate (a measuring unit of processing power).','0','0','2019-09-13 15:11:15','2019-11-02

','VeChain Thor (VET) is a cryptocurrency and smart contracts platform focused on enterprise use. It utilizes IoT technology (like NFC chips, RFID trackers, and QR codes) and connects them to a single distributed ledger.  According to the VeChain Foundation, partnerships have been developed with companies in several industries including luxury goods, automotive, agriculture, logistics, food/drug, and governments.\n\nSunny Lu, former Chief Information Officer of Louis Vuitton China, founded VeChain in 2015. Initially, VeChain launched as an ERC-20 token called VEN. In August 2017, VeChain held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) where 200,000 ETH was raised which was about $60 million at the time. \n\nOn June 30, 2018, VeChain released VeChain Thor on its own mainnet. With the roll-out of this independent blockchain, token holders swapped VEN for VET, at an exchange rate of 1:100. (VEN is no longer active.)\n\nThe VeChain Thor blockchain uses a dual token model. VET is the native token and functions as a store of value, whereas VTHO is used to pay for using and building apps on the blockchain. VTHO is automatically generated by owning VET. By using a dual token model, transaction fees remain more stable compared to a system where there is only one coin.\n\nThe VeChain Foundation, a Singapore based non-profit founded in 2017, maintains the VeChain Thor blockchain. \n\nInstead of using fully decentralized consensus models like PoW or PoS, new blocks on the VeChain Thor blockchain are validated via a “Proof-of-Authority” (PoA) consensus algorithm. An innovation of the Proof of Stake model, PoA consensus uses identity and reputation as the form of stake instead of actual tokens. With VeChain Thor’s version of PoA, 101 known validators (Authority Nodes) produce new blocks on the blockchain. Each Authority Node requires full KYC, a formal application, dedicated hardware for the Node, 250 million VET at a minimum, and ultimately selected by the VeChain Foundation.\n\nBecause the identities and reputations of the validators are at stake, it’s argued that the validators will be held accountable and incentivized to work in the best interest of the network’s growth and security. The benefit of using trusted validators is increased blockchain efficiency which allows for greater scalability and lower transaction fees while still remaining secure. \n\nThere is no mining on the VeChainThor blockchain. A 51% attack would require that 51 of the 101 validators collude with one another, which is unlikely. \n\nVeChain has a Blockchain-as-a-Service (\"BaaS\") platform called ToolChain. ToolChain is a blockchain platform offering services such as product lifecycle management, supply chain process control, data deposit, data certification, and process certification. ToolChain allows businesses of all sizes and technical abilities to utilize blockchain technology.\n\nVeChain has a number of impressive enterprise-grade partners including Walmart China, BYD, Renault, BMW, and PricewaterhouseCooper.\n\nVeChain is headquartered in Shanghai and has satellite offices in Singapore, Paris, Luxembourg, Palo Alto, Tokyo and Hong Kong.','0','0','2019-09-13

Atom is the native staking token of the Cosmos Network.  The Cosmos vision is to build an “internet of blockchains” that can scale and interoperate with one another.  \n\nOpen source tools like Tendermint Core, the Cosmos SDK, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) were created to accelerate the creation of blockchains in the Cosmos Network.\n\nTendermint Core is a BFT consensus algorithm.  With the Tendermint consensus algorithm, users get “instant finality,” which means forks are never created as long as more than a third of the Validators are honest.  Transactions are finalized as soon as a block is created (unlike proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum).\n\nThe Cosmos SDK is a generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint Core.  IBC is a protocol that connects independent blockchains together.  IBC allows heterogeneous chains to transfer value or data to each other and can work with any “fast-finality” blockchain engine.\n\nThe Cosmos Network consists of independent blockchains called “Zones” which are attached to central blockchains called “Hubs.”  Each Zone and Hub can choose its own BFT consensus algorithm and governance. \n\nThe first Hub in the Cosmos Network is the Cosmos Hub which launched in March of 2019.  The Cosmos Hub utilizes Tendermint Core which is a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol.   At the time of this writing, there are 100 Validators who secure the Cosmos Hub.  Validators get rewarded with Atom tokens for each block they produce.  Every year, the maximum number of Cosmos Hub Validators will increase according to a set schedule.  Atom token holders who do not qualify as Validators can stake their tokens with a Validator to earn rewards.\n\nThe Cosmos Network is supported by the Swiss non-profit organization called the Interchain Foundation (ICF).  Tendermint Inc is a California-based software company contracted by the ICF to develop the Cosmos Network.  Jae Kwon is the President of the Interchain Foundation and the CEO of Tindermint Inc.  Before Cosmos, Kwon was a Lead Mobile Developer at Yelp and a Developer at Flywheel Networks.  \n\n\nCosmos held their ICO in April 2017 and raised $17 million.  75 percent of the available token supply was sold in the ICO, 5 percent was withheld for seed investors, 10 percent was distributed to Tendermint Inc, and the last 10 percent was allocated to the Interchain Foundation.\n\nThe Cosmos mainnet launched on March 14, 2019.  On the same day, the Tendermint team announced their Series A investment round, raising $9 million.  The investment was led by Paradigm and included Bain Capital, 1confirmation, and other notable investors.','0','0','2019-10-22 18:52:47','2019-11-02 18:25:48',629376906.80,2713622068.14,0.00,0.00,0.101563,0.324942,-0.044909,0.000000,5233.10709000),(2164,929418,26,'CRO','Crypto.com Chain',0.03886,1.00,0.040038,5766642.55000,1.00,440644618.79,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/cro.jpg','1',1,'https://www.crypto.com/en/chain','N/A','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-10-22 18:53:38','2019-11-02 18:25:49',33110793.02,104815588.49,0.00,0.00,0.083724,0.096732,-0.300616,0.000000,-789.31447500),(2165,926388,40,'ABBC','ABBC Coin',0.24992,1.00,-0.009076,41613334.19000,1.00,138809952.76,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/abbc.jpg','1',1,'https://www.abbcfoundation.com/','X13','N/A',' ','','0','0','2019-10-22 18:54:30','2019-11-02 18:25:49',235032198.74,955404342.11,0.00,0.00,-0.186727,0.187975,0.000000,0.000000,-182.75592000),(2166,930992,56,'ALGO','Algorand',0.26821,1.00,0.090089,113830267.08000,1.00,115510608.86,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/ALGO.png','1',1,'https://www.algorand.com/','N/A','N/A',' ','Algo (ALGO) is the native token of the Algorand network.  Algo serves as a store of value and can be staked to facilitate consensus on the Algorand blockchain.  According to the website, Algorand is “a fully decentralized, secure, and scalable blockchain which provides a common platform for building products and services for a borderless economy.”\n\nAlgorand Inc. is an open-source software company founded in 2017 by cryptographer and MIT Professor, Silvio Micali.  Micali is co-inventor of several of the protocols that underpin much of modern cryptography such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, probabilistic encryption, and Verifiable Random Functions.  At Algorand, Micali leads the research team.  Algorand is led by CEO, Steve Kokinos.  Before coming on board in 2018, Kokinos was co-founder and Executive Charmain of Fuze, a global cloud-based unified communications platform.\n\nThe Algorand team believes that proof-of-work (PoW) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) systems are vulnerable to attack because they can easily become centralized.  Instead, the project created and uses a consensus mechanism called pure proof-of-stake (PPoS).  With the PPoS algorithm, all users are randomly, anonymously, and consistently selected to partake in the Algorand consensus protocol.  New blocks are created in two phases.  First, a single token holder is randomly chosen to propose the next block.  Afterward, 1,000 other token holders are randomly and anonymously selected to be part of a “committee” to approve the block proposed by the user in step one.  If there is consensus with the new block, it gets added to the blockchain.  All online token holders have the opportunity to be selected to propose and to vote. The probability of a specific user being chosen is directly proportional to how many Algos they have staked.  \n\nIn February 2018, Algorand received $4 million in seed funding from venture capital firms Pillar and Union Square Ventures. In October 2018, the company raised an additional $62 million to fund protocol development.  According to the press release, “The $62M comes from a broad global investment group representing the venture capital, cryptocurrency, and financial services communities.”\n\nThe total max supply of Algos is stated to be 10 billion.  All 10 billion tokens were minted in the genesis block.  The Algorand Foundation will distribute Algo tokens via a series of Dutch Auctions (a sale where the price is progressively reduced until a buyer is found).  The first auction was conducted on June 19th, 2019 where 25 million tokens were sold raising $60 million.  The foundation will continue to conduct regular public auctions with a total auction supply of up to 600 million Algos per year over the next five years until the circulating supply hits 10 billion.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Algorand is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.','0','0','2019-10-22 18:55:21','2019-11-02 18:25:49',577057985.85,1469012171.19,0.00,0.00,0.226538,0.169664,0.000000,0.000000,5903.71374500),(2167,928723,59,'BTT','BitTorrent',0.03827,1.00,0.105562,77.55000,1.00,2132490.27,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/bittorrent.png','1',1,'','TRC10','DPoS',' ','','0','0','2019-10-22 18:56:13','2019-11-02 18:24:53',104565311.86,521015243.55,0.00,0.00,0.000000,1.431211,0.000000,0.000000,18388.49644500),(2168,931810,79,'BDX','Beldex',0.07034,1.00,-0.031962,150766.11000,1.00,68947084.04,'1','https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nomics-api/static/images/currencies/BDX.png','1',1,'https://beldex.io/','CryptoNight','PoW',' ','Beldex is a privacy-enabled coin, giving power and control to its holders to perform public and private transactions.

The initiators of the project have set a goal — to decentralize the process of business expansion and take it beyond the framework of traditional partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe Bananacoin Project will facilitate wider recognition of blockchain technology on the commodity market, forming a close connection with blockchain communities — Bitcoin, Ethereum, WAVES and others. Bananacoin will create tokens using blockchain (Ethereum), and tokens will be emitted based on the export price of 1 kilogram of bananas.\r\n\r\nProject Description\r\nBananacoin is blockchain project aiming to achieve a core modification of the global banana production industry, similar to how Uber has revolutionized the taxi industry or how Upwork has brought freelancing to a new level. In short, the initiators of the project create processes in the production of organic bananas through the implementation of an economic element in the seemingly completely understood export relations of the product.\r\n\r\nBananacoin is using the proven TGE crowdfunding model, allowing backers to invest in expansion of production and become holders of Bananacoin tokens (BCO), which can be exchanged after project launch for goods or funds and are expected to more than double in value in 18 months’ time. \r\n\r\nAfter the realisation of the project, Bananacoin tokens will be exchangeable for a certain amount of Lady Finger bananas or equivalent monetary compensation. Because the token is backed by the market value of 1 kilogram of bananas, participants can be certain of the success of the project, as the demand for bananas is constant. Furthermore, Lady Finger bananas are considered to be among the best banana varieties, and the environmentally friendly technologies used in our project ensure that the good will remain an attractive investment and that its price will grow constantly','0','0','2019-10-22 20:11:01','2019-10-22
